    <dt>Question:</dt>
    <dd>"I seem to remember there was some script "build.sh" which would
    drive the build of the various packages; is this no longer supported?"</dd>

    <dt>Answer:</dt>
    <dd>Yes, initially the complete build and installation was run through a
    shell script, but this has been phased out in favor of having CMake do
    most of the job. Follow the instructions under \ref configure_build_install</dd>

     <dt>Question:</dt>
     <dd>"When I am running a command like e.g. <tt>make dal</tt> from within the
     build directory, all I am getting is
     \verbatim
     make: *** No rule to make target `dal'.  Stop.
     \endverbatim
     Why is that?</dd>

     <dt>Answer:</dt>
     <dd>The most likely explanation is that you haven't yet run CMake to
     parse the master configuration script to create the list of build
     targets.
     \code
	  cd $LOFARSOFT/build
	  ./bootstrap
	  \endcode
	  Once you have done this you can use 
	  \code
	  make help
	  \endcode
	  to get the list of available targets which can be build through
	  \code
	  make <package>
	  \endcode
	  </dd>
