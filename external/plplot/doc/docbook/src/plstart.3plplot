.SH NAME
\fBplstart\fP - Initialization 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplstart\fP(\fIdevice\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Alternative to \fBplstar\fP(3plplot) for initializing the plotting package.  The \fIdevice\fP name keyword for the desired output device must be supplied as an argument.  The device keywords are the same as those printed out by \fBplstar\fP(3plplot).  If the requested device is not available, or if the input string is empty or begins with ``?'', the prompted startup of \fBplstar\fP(3plplot) is used.  This routine also divides the output device into \fInx\fP by \fIny\fP subpages, each of which may be used independently.  The subroutine \fBpladv\fP(3plplot) is used to advance from one subpage to the next. 
.P
Redacted form:  General: \fBplstart(device, nx, ny)\fP
Perl/PDL: \fBplstart(nx, ny, device)\fP

.P
This function is not used in any examples. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIdevice\fP (const char *, input) 
Device name (keyword) of the required output device.  If NULL or if the first character is a ``?'', the normal (prompted) startup is used. 
.TP
\fInx\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of subpages to divide output page in the horizontal direction. 
.TP
\fIny\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of subpages to divide output page in the vertical direction.
