>&#13;      By this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of the
      underlying philosophy of Tcl and Tk, and the whole concept of
      extensions, of which [incr Tcl] and PLplot are examples.  These alone
      are enough to allow the rapid prototyping and development of
      powerful, flexible graphical applications.  Normally the programmer
      simply writes a shell script to be executed by the Tk windowing
      shell, <B
CLASS="command"
>wish</B
>.  It is in vogue for each Tcl/Tk
      extension package to build it's own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"extended WISH"</SPAN
>.
      There are many examples of this, and indeed even PLplot's
      <B
CLASS="command"
>plserver</B
> program, described in an earlier chapter,
      could just as easily have been called <B
CLASS="command"
>plwish</B
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In any event, as exciting and useful as these standalone, extended
      windowing shells may be, they are ultimately only the beginning of
      what you can do.  The real benefit of this approach is realized when
      you make your own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"extended WISH"</SPAN
>, comprised of Tcl, Tk,
      any of the standard extensions you like, and finally embellished with
      a smattering of application specific extensions designed to support
      your own application domain.  In this section we give a detailed
      introduction to the process of constructing your own WISH.  After
      that, you're on your own...

	extensions you will be requiring, add some commands to the
	interpreter, and link it all together.

>&#13;	Now you are ready to put the genie to work.  The basic plan here is
	to write shell scripts which use your new application specific
	windowing shell as their interpreter, to implement X Windows user
	interfaces to control and utilize the facilities made available in
	your extensions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Effectively this just comes down to writing Tcl/Tk code, embellished
	as appropriate with calls to the extension commands you registered.
	Additionally, since this wish includes the PLplot extensions, you
	can instantiate any of the PLplot family of [incr Tcl] classes, and
	invoke methods on those objects to effect the drawing of graphs.
	Similarly, you may have your extension commands (which are coded in
	C) call the PLplot C programmers API to draw into the widget.  In
	this way you can have the best of both worlds.  Use compiled C code
	when the computational demands require the speed of compiled code,
	or use Tcl when your programming convenience is more important than
	raw speed.
