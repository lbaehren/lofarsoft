>&#13;Contouring and shading has traditionally been one of the
messier things to do in PLplot.  The C API has many parameters, with
complex setup and tear down properties.  Of special concern is that
some of the parameters do not have a natural representation in script
languages like Tcl.  In this section we describe how the Tcl
interface to these facilities is provided, and how to use it.

>&#13;By way of reference, the primary C function call for contouring is:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;void plcont( PLFLT **f, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLINT kx, PLINT lx,
             PLINT ky, PLINT ly, PLFLT *clevel, PLINT nlevel,
             void (*pltr) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer),
             PLPointer pltr_data);
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;This is a fairly complex argument list, and so for this function (and
for plshade, described below) we dispense with trying to exactly
mirror the C API, and just concentrate on capturing the functionality
within a Tcl context.  To begin with, the data is provided through a
2-d Tcl matrix.  The Tcl matrix carries along its size information
with it, so <TT
CLASS="literal"
>nx</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ny</TT
> are no longer needed.  The
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>kx</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>lx</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ky</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>ly</TT
> variables are
potentially still  useful for plotting a subdomain of the full data
set, so they may be specified in the natural way, but we make this
optional since they are frequently not used to convey anything more
than what could be inferred from <TT
CLASS="literal"
>nx</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>ny</TT
>.  However, to
simplify processing, they must be supplied or omitted as a set (all of
them, or none of them).  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>clevel</TT
> is supplied as a 1-d Tcl
matrix, and so <TT
CLASS="literal"
>nlevel</TT
> can be omitted.  
</P
><P
>&#13;Finally, we have no way to support function pointers from Tcl, so
instead we provide token based support for accessing the three
coordinate transformation routines which are provided by PLplot, and
which many PLplot users use.  There are thus three courses of action:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;  Provide no pltr specification.  In this case, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr0</TT
> is
  used by default.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;  Specify <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr1 x y</TT
> where x and y are 1-d Tcl matrices.
  In this case <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr1</TT
> will be used, and the 1-d arrays which it
  needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices <TT
CLASS="literal"
>x</TT
> and
  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>y</TT
>.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;  Specify <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr2 x y</TT
> where x and y are 2-d Tcl matrices.
  In this case <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr2</TT
> will be used, and the 2-d arrays which it
  needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices <TT
CLASS="literal"
>x</TT
> and
  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>y</TT
>.
  </P
></LI
></UL
>

</P
><P
>&#13;Now, there can be no question that this is both more concise and less
powerful than what you could get in C.  The loss of the ability to
provide a user specified transformation function is regrettable.  If
you really do need that functionality, you will have to implement your
own Tcl extension command to do pretty much the same thing as the
provided Tcl extension command <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plcont</TT
> (which is in
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>tclAPI.c</TT
> in function <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plcontCmd()</TT
>), except specify the C
transformation function of your choice.
</P
><P
>&#13;However, that having been said, we recognize that one common use for
this capability is to provide a special version of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr2</TT
> which
knows how to implement a periodic boundary condition, so that polar
plots, for example, can be implemented cleanly.  That is, if you want
to draw contours of a polar data set defined on a 64 x 64 grid,
ensuring that contour lines would actually go all the way around the
origin rather than breaking off like a silly pacman figure, then you
had basically two choices in C.  You could copy the data to a 65 x 64
grid, and replicate one row of data into the spare slot, and then plot
the larger data set (taking care to replicate the coordinate arrays
you passed to pltr2 in the same way), <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>or</I
></SPAN
> you could make a
special version of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr2</TT
> which would understand that one of the
coordinates was wrapped, and perform transformations accordingly
without actually making you replicate the data.
</P
><P
>&#13;Since the former option is ugly in general, and hard to do in Tcl in
particular, and since the second option is even more difficult to do
in Tcl (requiring you do make a special Tcl extension command as
described above), we provide special, explicit support for this common
activity.  This is provided through the use of a new, optional
parameter <TT
CLASS="literal"
>wrap</TT
> which may be specified as the last parameter to
the Tcl command, only if you are using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltr2</TT
>.  Supplying
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>1</TT
> will wrap in the first coordinate, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>2</TT
> will wrap in the
second coordinate.
</P

>&#13;The resultant Tcl command is:

</P
><P
>&#13;The Tcl demo <TT

of this interface to contouring from Tcl.  Note in particular,
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>x09_polar</TT

complicated in the way of setup, and without getting a pacman as the
output.
