> PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making
scientific plots from programs written in C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran95, Java, Octave, 
Perl, Python, and Tcl/Tk. The PLplot project is being developed by a world-wide 
team who interact via the facilities provided by SourceForge (<A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot</A
>)
</P

> The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, shade (gray-scale and color)
plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same
or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in
each graph. Different line styles, widths and colors are supported. A
virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used. 
There is full unicode support in the PLplot library, and most of the
display drivers are capable of displaying any of the millions(?) of
characters in the unicode standard. Those driver that are not unicode
enabled can still display almost 1000 characters in the extended character set. 
This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of 
mathematical, musical, and other symbols. A variety of output devices and 
file formats are supported including a metafile format which can be 
subsequently rendered to any device/file.  New devices and file formats can 
be easily added by writing a driver routine. For example, we have recently 
added a postscript driver with TrueType font support (PSTTF), a SVG file 
driver and a PDF file driver. A wxWidgets interactive driver is currently 
in development.

>&#13;      PLplot was originally developed by Sze Tan of the University of
      Auckland in Fortran-77.  Many of the underlying concepts used in the
      PLplot package are based on ideas used in Tim Pearson's PGPLOT
      package.  Sze Tan writes:

>&#13;	I'm rather amazed how far PLPLOT has traveled given its origins
	etc. I first used PGPLOT on the Starlink VAX computers while I was
	a graduate student at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in
	Cambridge from 1983-1987. At the beginning of 1986, I was to give a
	seminar within the department at which I wanted to have a computer
	graphics demonstration on an IBM PC which was connected to a
	completely non-standard graphics card. Having about a week to do
	this and not having any drivers for the card, I started from the
	back end and designed PLPLOT to be such that one only needed to be
	able to draw a line or a dot on the screen in order to do arbitrary
	graphics.  The application programmer's interface was made as
	similar as possible to PGPLOT so that I could easily port my
	programs from the VAX to the PC.  The kernel of PLPLOT was modeled
	on PGPLOT but the code is not derived from it.

>&#13;      The C version of PLplot was developed by Tony Richardson on a
      Commodore Amiga.  In the process, several of the routines were
      rewritten to improve efficiency and some new features added.  The
      program structure was changed somewhat to make it easier to
      incorporate new devices.  Additional features were added to allow
      three-dimensional plotting and better access to low-level routines.

>&#13;      PLplot 5.0 is a continuation of our work on PLplot 4.0, which never
      got widely distributed.  It became clear during the work on 4.0 that
      in order to support an interactive driver under Unix (using Tcl/Tk),
      many additions to the basic capabilities of the package were needed.
      So without stopping to fully document and bug-fix the 4.0 additions,
      work on 5.0 was begun.  The result is that a very capable
      PLplot-based widget for the Tk toolkit has been written.  This widget
      can manipulate the plot (zoom/pan, scale, orient, change colors), as
      well dump it to any supported device.  There are help menus and user
      customization options.  These are still in the process of being
      documented.

>&#13;      Other changes include the introduction of a new color palette (cmap1)
      for smooth color shaded images (typically for 2d or 3d plots &#8211;
      in which color represents function intensity), support for color fill
      plots, and lots more cool stuff.  The manual has been rewritten in
      LaTeXinfo, so that there is now a printed version and an online
      (info) version of the document.  The manual is still in a state of
      flux and will be fleshed out in more detail in later updates.
    </P

>&#13;      Some of the improvements in PLplot 5.0 include: the addition of
      several new routines to enhance usage from Fortran and design of a
      portable C to Fortran interface.  Additional support was added for
      coordinate mappings in contour plots and some bugs fixed.  New
      labeling options were added.  The font handling code was made more
      flexible and portable.  A portable PLplot metafile driver and
      renderer was developed, allowing one to create a generic graphics
      file and do the actual rendering later (even on a different
      system).  The ability to create family output files was added.  The
      internal code structure was dramatically reworked, with elimination
      of global variables (for a more robust package), the drivers
      rewritten to improve consistency, and the ability to maintain
      multiple output streams added.  An XFig driver was added.  Other
      contributions include Clair Nielsen's (LANL) X-window driver (very
      nice for high-speed color graphics) and tektronix file viewer.  At
      present, Maurice LeBrun and Geoff Furnish are the active developers
      and maintainers of PLplot.

>&#13;      We have attempted to keep PLplot 5.0 backward compatible with
      previous versions of PLplot.  However, some functions are now
      obsolete, and many new ones have been added (e.g.  new contouring
      functions, variable get/set routines, functions that affect label
      appearance).  Codes written in C that use PLplot must be recompiled
      including the new header file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>plplot.h</TT
> before
      linking to the new PLplot library.

>&#13;      PLplot is currently known to work on the following systems:
      Unix/Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows XP. The Unix/Linux version is
      the best supported of these possibilities.
      The PLplot package is freely
      distributable, but <SPAN

      See <A

>&#13;      We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in
      the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLplot
      is used in any published papers, please include an acknowledgment
      or citation of our work, which will help us to continue improving
      PLplot.  Please direct all communication to the general PLplot
