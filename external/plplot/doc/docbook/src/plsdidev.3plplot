.SH NAME
\fBplsdidev\fP - Set parameters that define current device-space window 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsdidev\fP(\fImar\fP, \fIaspect\fP, \fIjx\fP, \fIjy\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set relative margin width, aspect ratio, and relative justification that define current device-space window.  If you want to just use the previous value for any of these, just pass in the magic value PL_NOTSET. It is unlikely that one should ever need to change the aspect ratio but it's in there for completeness. If \fBplsdidev\fP(3plplot) is not called the default values of \fImar\fP, \fIjx\fP, and \fIjy\fP are all 0. \fIaspect\fP is set to a device-specific value. 
.P
Redacted form: \fBplsdidev(mar, aspect, jx, jy)\fP
