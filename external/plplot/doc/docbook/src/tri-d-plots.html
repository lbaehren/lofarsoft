>&#13;      PLplot includes routines that will represent a single-valued function
      of two variables as a surface.  In this section, we shall assume that
      the function to be plotted is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Z[X][Y]</TT
>, where
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Z</TT
> represents the dependent variable and
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>X</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Y</TT
> represent the
      independent variables.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      As usual, we would like to refer to a three dimensional point
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>(X, Y, Z)</TT
> in terms of some meaningful
      user-specified coordinate system.  These are called
      <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>three-dimensional world coordinates</I
></SPAN
>.  We need to
      specify the ranges of these coordinates, so that the entire surface
      is contained within the cuboid defined by <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xmin &#60; x &#60;
      xmax</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ymin &#60; y &#60; ymax</TT
>, and
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>zmin &#60; z &#60; zmax</TT
>.  Typically, we shall want
      to view the surface from a variety of angles, and to facilitate this,
      a two-stage mapping of the enclosing cuboid is performed.  Firstly,
      it is mapped into another cuboid called the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>normalized
      box</I
></SPAN
> whose size must also be specified by the user, and
      secondly this normalized box is viewed from a particular azimuth and
      elevation so that it can be projected onto the two-dimensional
      window.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This two-stage transformation process allows considerable flexibility
      in specifying how the surface is depicted.  The lengths of the sides
      of the normalized box are independent of the world coordinate ranges
      of each of the variables, making it possible to use
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"reasonable"</SPAN
> viewing angles even if the ranges of the
      world coordinates on the axes are very different.  The size of the
      normalized box is determined essentially by the size of the
      two-dimensional window into which it is to be mapped.  The normalized
      box is centered about the origin in the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>x</TT
> and
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>y</TT
> directions, but rests on the plane <TT
CLASS="literal"
>z =
      0</TT
>.  It is viewed by an observer located at altitude
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>alt</TT
> and azimuth <TT
CLASS="literal"
>az</TT
>, where both
      angles are measured in degrees.  The altitude should be restricted to
      the range zero to ninety degrees for proper operation, and represents
      the viewing angle above the xy plane.  The azimuth is defined so that
      when <TT
CLASS="literal"
>az = 0</TT
>, the observer sees the xz plane face
      on, and as the angle is increased, the observer moves clockwise
      around the box as viewed from above the xy plane.  The azimuth can
      take on any value.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The first step in drawing a surface plot is to decide on the size of
      the two-dimensional window and the normalized box.  For example, we
      could choose the normalized box to have sides of length

>&#13;      A reasonable range for the x coordinate of the two-dimensional window
      is -2.5 to +2.5, since the length of the diagonal across the base of
      the normalized box is
      sqrt(2<SUP
>2</SUP
>+4<SUP
>2</SUP
>) =
      2 sqrt(5), which fits into this coordinate range.  A reasonable
      range for the y coordinate of the two dimensional window in this case
      is -2.5 to +4, as the the projection of the normalized box lies in
      this range for the allowed range of viewing angles.

>&#13;      The values of the function are stored in a two-dimensional array
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>z[][]</TT

      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>z[i][j]</TT
> contains the value of the function at the
      point x<SUB
>i</SUB
>, y<SUB
>j</SUB
>.  (The
      two-dimensional array <TT
CLASS="literal"
>z</TT
> is a vectored array
      instead of a fixed size array.  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>z</TT
> points to an
      array of pointers which each point to a row of the matrix.)  Note
      that the values of the independent variables
      x<SUB
>i</SUB
> and y<SUB
>j</SUB
> do not need
      to be equally spaced, but they must lie on a rectangular grid.  Thus
      two further arrays <TT
CLASS="literal"
>x[nx]</TT
> and
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>y[ny]</TT
> are required as arguments to <A
HREF="plot3d.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plot3d</CODE
></A
> to
      specify the values of the independent variables.  The values in the
      arrays x and y must be strictly increasing with the index.  The
      argument <TT
CLASS="literal"
>opt</TT
> specifies how the surface is
      outlined.  If <TT
CLASS="literal"
>opt = 1</TT
>, a line is drawn
      representing z as a function of x for each value of y, if
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>opt = 2</TT
>, a line is drawn representing z as a
      function of y for each value of x, and if <TT
CLASS="literal"
>opt = 3</TT
>,
      a net of lines is drawn.  The first two options may be preferable if
      one of the independent variables is to be regarded as a parameter,
      whilst the third is better for getting an overall picture of the
      surface.  If side is equal to one then sides are drawn on the figure
      so that the graph doesn't appear to float.

>&#13;      The routine <A
HREF="plmesh.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plmesh</CODE
></A
> is similar to <A
HREF="plot3d.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plot3d</CODE
></A
>, except that it is used
      for drawing mesh plots.  Mesh plots allow you to see both the top and
      bottom sides of a surface mesh, while 3D plots allow you to see the
      top side only (like looking at a solid object).  The side option is
      not available with <A

><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plmesh</CODE
></A

    </P
><P
>&#13;      Labeling a three-dimensional or mesh plot is somewhat more
      complicated than a two dimensional plot due to the need for skewing
      the characters in the label so that they are parallel to the
      coordinate axes.  The routine <A
HREF="plbox3.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
> plbox3</CODE
></A
> thus combines the functions of
      box drawing and labeling.
