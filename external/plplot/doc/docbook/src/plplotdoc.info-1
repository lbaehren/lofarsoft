1.1 The PLplot Plotting Library
===============================

PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making
scientific plots from programs written in C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran95,
Java, Octave, Perl, Python, and Tcl/Tk. The PLplot project is being
developed by a world-wide team who interact via the facilities provided
by SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot))

   The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, shade (gray-scale and
color) plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs
(of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with
multiple lines in each graph. Different line styles, widths and colors
are supported. A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill
patterns may be used.  There is full unicode support in the PLplot
library, and most of the display drivers are capable of displaying any
of the millions(?) of characters in the unicode standard. Those driver
that are not unicode enabled can still display almost 1000 characters
in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the
Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.
A variety of output devices and file formats are supported including a
metafile format which can be subsequently rendered to any device/file.
New devices and file formats can be easily added by writing a driver
routine. For example, we have recently added a postscript driver with
TrueType font support (PSTTF), a SVG file driver and a PDF file driver.
A wxWidgets interactive driver is currently in development.

   PLplot was originally developed by Sze Tan of the University of
Auckland in Fortran-77. Many of the underlying concepts used in the
PLplot package are based on ideas used in Tim Pearson's PGPLOT package.
Sze Tan writes:

     I'm rather amazed how far PLPLOT has traveled given its origins
     etc. I first used PGPLOT on the Starlink VAX computers while I was
     a graduate student at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in
     Cambridge from 1983-1987. At the beginning of 1986, I was to give a
     seminar within the department at which I wanted to have a computer
     graphics demonstration on an IBM PC which was connected to a
     completely non-standard graphics card. Having about a week to do
     this and not having any drivers for the card, I started from the
     back end and designed PLPLOT to be such that one only needed to be
     able to draw a line or a dot on the screen in order to do arbitrary
     graphics. The application programmer's interface was made as
     similar as possible to PGPLOT so that I could easily port my
     programs from the VAX to the PC. The kernel of PLPLOT was modeled
     on PGPLOT but the code is not derived from it.

   The C version of PLplot was developed by Tony Richardson on a
Commodore Amiga. In the process, several of the routines were rewritten
to improve efficiency and some new features added. The program
structure was changed somewhat to make it easier to incorporate new
devices. Additional features were added to allow three-dimensional
plotting and better access to low-level routines.

   PLplot 5.0 is a continuation of our work on PLplot 4.0, which never
got widely distributed. It became clear during the work on 4.0 that in
order to support an interactive driver under Unix (using Tcl/Tk), many
additions to the basic capabilities of the package were needed.  So
without stopping to fully document and bug-fix the 4.0 additions, work
on 5.0 was begun. The result is that a very capable PLplot-based widget
for the Tk toolkit has been written. This widget can manipulate the
plot (zoom/pan, scale, orient, change colors), as well dump it to any
supported device. There are help menus and user customization options.
These are still in the process of being documented.

   Other changes include the introduction of a new color palette (cmap1)
for smooth color shaded images (typically for 2d or 3d plots - in which
color represents function intensity), support for color fill plots, and
lots more cool stuff. The manual has been rewritten in LaTeXinfo, so
that there is now a printed version and an online (info) version of the
document. The manual is still in a state of flux and will be fleshed
out in more detail in later updates.

   Some of the improvements in PLplot 5.0 include: the addition of
several new routines to enhance usage from Fortran and design of a
portable C to Fortran interface. Additional support was added for
coordinate mappings in contour plots and some bugs fixed. New labeling
options were added. The font handling code was made more flexible and
portable. A portable PLplot metafile driver and renderer was developed,
allowing one to create a generic graphics file and do the actual
rendering later (even on a different system). The ability to create
family output files was added. The internal code structure was
dramatically reworked, with elimination of global variables (for a more
robust package), the drivers rewritten to improve consistency, and the
ability to maintain multiple output streams added. An XFig driver was
added. Other contributions include Clair Nielsen's (LANL) X-window
driver (very nice for high-speed color graphics) and tektronix file
viewer. At present, Maurice LeBrun and Geoff Furnish are the active
developers and maintainers of PLplot.

   We have attempted to keep PLplot 5.0 backward compatible with
previous versions of PLplot. However, some functions are now obsolete,
and many new ones have been added (e.g. new contouring functions,
variable get/set routines, functions that affect label appearance).
Codes written in C that use PLplot must be recompiled including the new
header file `plplot.h' before linking to the new PLplot library.

   PLplot is currently known to work on the following systems:
Unix/Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows XP. The Unix/Linux version is the best
supported of these possibilities.  The PLplot package is freely
distributable, but not in the public domain.  See *Note Copyrights:
Copyrights. for distribution criteria.

   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in
the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes. If PLplot is
used in any published papers, please include an acknowledgment or
citation of our work, which will help us to continue improving PLplot.
Please direct all communication to the general PLplot mailing list,
plplot-general@lists.sourceforge.net.

1.2 Getting a Copy of the PLplot Package
========================================

At present, the only mechanism we are providing for distribution of the
PLplot is by electronic transmission over the Internet. We encourage
others to make it available to users without Internet access. PLplot is
a SourceForge project and may be obtained by the usual SourceForge file
release and anonymous cvs access that is made available from links at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot).

1.3 Installing and Using the PLplot Library
===========================================

The installation procedure is by necessity system specific;
installation notes for each system are provided in *Note Notes for each
Operating System that We Support: Notes for each Operating System that
We Support..  The procedure requires that all of the routines be
compiled and they are then usually placed in a linkable library.

   After the library has been created, you can write your main program
to make the desired PLplot calls. Example programs in C, C++,
Fortran77, Fortran95 and Java are included as a guide.  Plots generated
from the example programs are shown here
(http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html).

   You will then need to compile your program and link it with the
PLplot library(s). See *Note Notes for each Operating System that We
Support: Notes for each Operating System that We Support. for more
details).

   You can also use Tcl/Tk, Perl and Python scripts to generate plots
using the PLplot libraries. Examples of these possibilities are also
included as a guide.

1.4 Organization of this Manual
===============================

The PLplot library has been designed so that it is easy to write
programs producing graphical output without having to set up large
numbers of parameters. However, more precise control of the results may
be necessary, and these are accommodated by providing lower-level
routines which change the system defaults. The manual first describes
the overall process of producing a graph using the high-level routines
(see *Note Plotting a Simple Graph: Plotting a Simple Graph.). For a
discussion of the underlying concepts of the plotting process and an
introduction to some of the more complex routines (see *Note Advanced
Use of PLplot: Advanced Use of PLplot.).  An alphabetical list of the
user-accessible PLplot functions with detailed descriptions is given in
the reference section of the manual (see *Note The Common API for
PLplot: The Common API for PLplot.).

   Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used
in the description of each PLplot function. If you have difficulty
interpreting the call syntax as described in this manual, please refer
to part III, Language Bindings. This manual includes: C (*Note C
Language: C Language.), C++ (*Note A C++ Interface for PLplot: A C++
Interface for PLplot.), Fortran 95 (*Note Fortran 95 Language: Fortran
95 Language.), Fortran 77 (*Note Fortran 77 Language: Fortran 77
Language.), Java (???), Tcl (*Note Using PLplot from Tcl: Using PLplot
from Tcl.), Perl (*Note Using PLplot from Perl: Using PLplot from
Perl.) and Python (*Note Using PLplot from Python: Using PLplot from
Python.). Since PLplot has a long history, bindings to your language of
choice are probably available though not necessarily in the PLplot
distribution. It is a good idea to ask around and do a quick search
before rolling your own.

   The meaning of the function (subroutine) arguments is typically the
same regardless of what language you are using to call PLplot (but
there are some exceptions to this). The arguments for each function are
usually specified in terms of PLBOOL, PLINT,and PLFLT--these are the
internal PLplot representations for logical, integer, and floating
point, and are typically a zero (false) or non-zero (true) contained in
a long, a long, and a float (or a LOGICAL, INTEGER, and a REAL, for
Fortran programmers). See *Note C Language: C Language. for more detail.

   Most of the output devices supported by PLplot are listed in *Note
The PLplot Display Driver Family: The PLplot Display Driver Family. and
*Note The PLplot Output Driver Family: The PLplot Output Driver Family.,
along with description of the device driver-PLplot interface, metafile
output, family files, and vt100/tek4010 emulators.

2.1 Plotting a Simple Graph
===========================

We shall first consider plotting simple graphs showing the dependence
of one variable upon another. Such a graph may be composed of several
elements:

   * A box which defines the ranges of the variables, perhaps with axes
     and numeric labels along its edges.

   * A set of points or lines within the box showing the functional
     dependence.

   * A set of labels for the variables and a title for the graph.

   In order to draw such a graph, it is necessary to call at least four
of the PLplot functions:

  1. `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::), to initialize PLplot.

  2. `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::), to
     define the range and scale of the graph, and draw labels, axes,
     etc.

  3. One or more calls to `plline' (*note plline; Draw a line::) or
     `plpoin' (*note plpoin; Plots a character at the specified
     points::) to draw lines or points as needed. Other more complex
     routines include `plbin' (*note plbin; Plot a histogram from
     binned data::) and `plhist' (*note plhist; Plot a histogram from
     unbinned data::) to draw histograms, `plerrx' (*note plerrx; Draw
     x error bar::) and `plerry' (*note plerry; Draw y error bar::) to
     draw error-bars.

  4. `plend' (*note plend; End plotting session::), to close the plot.

   More than one graph can be drawn on a single set of axes by making
repeated calls to the routines listed in item 3 above. PLplot only
needs to be initialized once unless plotting to multiple output devices.

2.2 Initializing PLplot
=======================

Before any actual plotting calls are made, a graphics program must call
`plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::), is the main
initialization routine for PLplot. It sets up all internal data
structures necessary for plotting and initializes the output device
driver. If the output device has not already been specified when
`plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) is called, a list of valid
output devices is given and the user is prompted for a choice.  Either
the device number or a device keyword is accepted.

   There are several routines affecting the initialization that must be
called before `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::), if they are
used. The function `plsdev' (*note plsdev; Set the device [keyword]
name::) allows you to set the device explicitly. The function
`plsetopt' (*note plsetopt; Set any command-line option::) allows you
to set any command-line option internally in your code. The function
`plssub' (*note plssub; Set the number of subpages in x and y::) may be
called to divide the output device plotting area into several subpages
of equal size, each of which can be used separately.

   One advances to the next page (or screen) via `pladv' (*note pladv;
Advance the [sub-]page::). If subpages are used, this can be used to
advance to the next subpage or to a particular subpage.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Defining Plot Scales and Axes,  Next: Labeling the Graph,  Prev: Initializing PLplot,  Up: Simple Use of PLplot

2.3 Defining Plot Scales and Axes
=================================

The function `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw
box::) is used to define the scales and axes for simple graphs. `plenv'
(*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::) starts a new
picture on the next subpage (or a new page if necessary), and defines
the ranges of the variables required.  The routine will also draw a
box, axes, and numeric labels if requested. The syntax for `plenv'
(*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::) is:

     plenv (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, just, axis);

`xmin, xmax'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The left and right limits for the horizontal axis.

`ymin, ymax'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The bottom and top limits for the vertical axis.

`just'  (`PLINT', input)
     This should be zero or one. If `just' is one, the scales of the
     x-axis and y-axis will be the same (in units per millimeter);
     otherwise the axes are scaled independently. This parameter is
     useful for ensuring that objects such as circles have the correct
     aspect ratio in the final plot.

`axis'  (`PLINT', input)
     `axis' controls whether a box, tick marks, labels, axes, and/or a
     grid are drawn.

        * `axis' = -2: No box or annotation.

        * `axis' = -1: Draw box only.

        * `axis' = 0: Draw box, labeled with coordinate values around
          edge.

        * `axis' = 1: In addition to box and labels, draw the two axes
          X = 0 and Y = 0.

        * `axis' = 2: Same as `axis' = 1, but also draw a grid at the
          major tick interval.

        * `axis' = 10: Logarithmic X axis, linear Y axis.

        * `axis' = 11: Logarithmic X axis, linear Y axis and draw line
          Y = 0.

        * `axis' = 20: Linear X axis, logarithmic Y axis.

        * `axis' = 21: Linear X axis, logarithmic Y axis and draw line
          X = 0.

        * `axis' = 30: Logarithmic X and Y axes.

   Note: Logarithmic axes only affect the appearance of the axes and
their labels, so it is up to the user to compute the logarithms prior
to passing them to `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and
draw box::) and any of the other routines. Thus, if a graph has a
3-cycle logarithmic axis from 1 to 1000, we need to set `xmin' =
`log_10'(1) = 0.0, and `xmax' = `log_10'(1000) = 3.0.

   For greater control over the size of the plots, axis labeling and
tick intervals, more complex graphs should make use of the functions
`plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates::), `plvasp'
(*note plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only::), `plvpas'
(*note plvpas; Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio::),
`plwind' (*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport
boundaries::), `plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::), and
routines for manipulating axis labeling `plgxax' (*note plgxax; Get x
axis parameters::) through `plszax' (*note plszax; Set z axis
parameters::).

2.4 Labeling the Graph
======================

The function `pllab' (*note pllab; Simple routine to write labels::)
may be called after `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and
draw box::) to write labels on the x and y axes, and at the top of the
picture. All the variables are character variables or constants.
Trailing spaces are removed and the label is centered in the
appropriate field. The syntax for `pllab' (*note pllab; Simple routine
to write labels::) is:

     pllab (xlbl, ylbl, toplbl);

`xlbl' (`char *', input)
     Pointer to string with label for the X-axis (bottom of graph).

`ylbl' (`char *', input)
     Pointer to string with label for the Y-axis (left of graph).

`toplbl' (`char *', input)
     Pointer to string with label for the plot (top of picture).}

   More complex labels can be drawn using the function `plmtex' (*note
plmtex; Write text relative to viewport boundaries::). For discussion
of writing text in a plot see *Note Writing Text on a Graph: Writing
Text on a Graph., and for more detailed discussion about label
generation see *Note Writing Text on a Graph: Writing Text on a Graph..

2.5 Drawing the Graph
=====================

PLplot can draw graphs consisting of points with optional error bars,
line segments or histograms. Functions which perform each of these
actions may be called after setting up the plotting environment using
`plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::). All of
the following functions draw within the box defined by `plenv' (*note
plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::), and any lines crossing
the boundary are clipped.  Functions are also provided for drawing
surface and contour representations of multi-dimensional functions. See
*Note Advanced Use of PLplot: Advanced Use of PLplot. for discussion of
finer control of plot generation.

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Drawing Points,  Next: Drawing Lines or Curves,  Up: Drawing the Graph

2.5.1 Drawing Points
--------------------

`plpoin' (*note plpoin; Plots a character at the specified points::)
and `plsym' (*note plsym; Plots a symbol at the specified points::)
mark out `n' points `(x[i], y[i])' with the specified symbol. The
routines differ only in the interpretation of the symbol codes.
`plpoin' (*note plpoin; Plots a character at the specified points::)
uses an extended ASCII representation, with the printable ASCII codes
mapping to the respective characters in the current font, and the codes
from 0-31 mapping to various useful symbols. In `plsym' (*note plsym;
Plots a symbol at the specified points::) however, the code is a
Hershey font code number. Example programs are provided which display
each of the symbols available using these routines.

     plpoin(n, x, y, code);

     plsym (n, x, y, code);

`n' (`PLINT', input)
     The number of points to plot.

`x, y' (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointers to arrays of the coordinates of the `n' points.

`code' (`PLINT',  input)
     Code number of symbol to draw


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Drawing Lines or Curves,  Next: Writing Text on a Graph,  Prev: Drawing Points,  Up: Drawing the Graph

2.5.2 Drawing Lines or Curves
-----------------------------

PLplot provides two functions for drawing line graphs. All lines are
drawn in the currently selected color, style and width. See *Note
Setting Line Attributes: Setting Line Attributes. for information about
changing these parameters.

   `plline' (*note plline; Draw a line::) draws a line or curve. The
curve consists of `n-1' line segments joining the `n' points in the
input arrays. For single line segments, `pljoin' (*note pljoin; Draw a
line between two points::) is used to join two points.

     plline (n, x, y);

`n' (`PLINT', input)
     The number of points.

`x, y' (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointers to arrays with coordinates of the `n' points.

     pljoin (x1, y1, x2, y2);

`x1, y1' (`PLFLT', input)
     Coordinates of the first point.

`x2, y2' (`PLFLT', input)
     Coordinates of the second point.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Writing Text on a Graph,  Next: Area Fills,  Prev: Drawing Lines or Curves,  Up: Drawing the Graph

2.5.3 Writing Text on a Graph
-----------------------------

`plptex' (*note plptex; Write text inside the viewport::) allows text
to be written within the limits set by `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up
standard window and draw box::).  The reference point of a text string
may be located anywhere along an imaginary horizontal line passing
through the string at half the height of a capital letter. The parameter
`just' specifies where along this line the reference point is located.
The string is then rotated about the reference point through an angle
specified by the parameters `dx' and `dy', so that the string becomes
parallel to a line joining `(x, y)' to `(x+dx, y+dy)'.

     plptex (x, y, dx, dy, just, text);

`x, y' (`PLFLT', input)
     Coordinates of the reference point.

`dx, dy' (`PLFLT', input)
     These specify the angle at which the text is to be printed.  The
     text is written parallel to a line joining the points `(x, y)' to
     `(x+dx, y+dy)' on the graph.

`dx, dy' (`PLFLT', input)
     These specify the angle at which the text is to be printed.  The
     text is written parallel to a line joining the points `(x, y)' to
     `(x+dx, y+dy)' on the graph.

`just' (`PLFLT', input)
     Determines justification of the string by specifying which point
     within the string is placed at the reference point `(x, y)'. This
     parameter is a fraction of the distance along the string. Thus if
     ``just' = 0.0', the reference point is at the left-hand edge of
     the string. If ``just' = 0.5', it is at the center and if ``just' =
     1.0', it is at the right-hand edge.

`text' (`char *', input)
     Pointer to the string of characters to be written.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Area Fills,  Next: More Complex Graphs,  Prev: Writing Text on a Graph,  Up: Drawing the Graph

2.5.4 Area Fills
----------------

Area fills are done in the currently selected color, line style, line
width and pattern style.

   `plfill' (*note plfill; Draw filled polygon::) fills a polygon. The
polygon consists of `n' vertices which define the polygon.

     plfill (n, x, y);

`n' (`PLINT', input)
     The number of vertices.

`x, y' (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointers to arrays with coordinates of the `n' vertices.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: More Complex Graphs,  Prev: Area Fills,  Up: Drawing the Graph

2.5.5 More Complex Graphs
-------------------------

Functions `plbin' (*note plbin; Plot a histogram from binned data::)
and `plhist' (*note plhist; Plot a histogram from unbinned data::) are
provided for drawing histograms, and functions `plerrx' (*note plerrx;
Draw x error bar::) and `plerry' (*note plerry; Draw y error bar::)
draw error bars about specified points. There are lots more too (see
*Note The Common API for PLplot: The Common API for PLplot.).

2.6 Finishing Up
================

Before the end of the program, always call `plend' (*note plend; End
plotting session::) to close any output plot files and to free up
resources. For devices that have separate graphics and text modes,
`plend' (*note plend; End plotting session::) resets the device to text
mode.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: In Case of Error,  Prev: Finishing Up,  Up: Simple Use of PLplot

2.7 In Case of Error
====================

If a fatal error is encountered during execution of a PLplot routine
then `plexit' (*note plexit; Error exit::) is called. This routine
prints an error message, does resource recovery, and then exits. The
user may specify an error handler via `plsexit' that gets called before
anything else is done, allowing either the user to abort the error
termination, or clean up user-specific data structures before exit.

3.1 Command Line Arguments
==========================

PLplot supports a large number of command line arguments, but it is up
to the user to pass these to PLplot for processing at the beginning of
execution.  `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse command-line
arguments::) is responsible for parsing the argument list, removing all
that are recognized by PLplot, and taking the appropriate action before
returning. There are an extensive number of options available to affect
this process. The command line arguments recognized by PLplot are given
by the -h option:


     % x01c -h
     Usage:
             ./x01c [options]

     PLplot options:
         -h                   Print out this message

         -fam                 Create a family of output files
         -fsiz size[kKmMgG]   Output family file size in MB (e.g. -fsiz 0.5G, def MB)
         -fbeg number         First family member number on output
         -finc number         Increment between family members

   The command-line options can also be set using the `plsetopt' (*note
plsetopt; Set any command-line option::) function, if invoked before
`plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::).

   Some options are may not be recognized by individual drivers. If an
option is not recognized but should be, please contact the driver
author via the plplot mailing lists.

   Many drivers have specific options that can be set using the -drvopt
command line option or with `plsetopt' (*note plsetopt; Set any
command-line option::). These options are documented in *Note The
PLplot Display Driver Family: The PLplot Display Driver Family. and
*Note The PLplot Output Driver Family: The PLplot Output Driver Family..

3.2 Output Devices
==================

PLplot supports a variety of output devices, via a set of device
drivers.  Each driver is required to emulate a small set of low-level
graphics primitives such as initialization, line draw and page advance,
as well as be completely independent of the PLplot package as a whole.
Thus a driver may be very simple, as in the case of the many black and
white file drivers (tektronix, etc.). More complicated and/or color
systems require a bit more effort by the driver, with the most effort
required by an output device with a graphical user interface, including
menus for screen dumps, palette manipulation, and so forth. At present
only the tk driver does the latter on Unix systems. At present we
aren't pursuing a Macintosh development effort due to a lack of time
and expertise, but will assist anyone wanting to volunteer for the job.

   Note that if you always render to a PLplot metafile, you can always
`plrender' them to new devices as they become available.

   The list of available devices presented when starting PLplot (via
`plstar') is determined at compile time. When installing PLplot you may
wish to exclude devices not available on your system in order to reduce
screen clutter. To include a specified device, simply define the
appropriate macro constant when building PLplot (see the installation
instructions for your system).

   The device drivers for PLplot terminal output at present are given in
*Note PLplot Terminal Output Devices: PLplot Terminal Output Devices.
while drivers for file output are given in *Note PLplot File Output
Devices: PLplot File Output Devices..  The driver for OS/2 PM is
available separately. See the section on OS/2 in the Appendix for more
details.

3.2.1 Driver Functions
----------------------

A dispatch table is used to direct function calls to whatever driver is
chosen at run-time. Below are listed the names of each entry in the
PLDispatchTable dispatch table struct defined in `plcore.h'. The
entries specific to each device (defined in `drivers/*.c') are
typically named similarly but with pl_ replaced by a string specific
for that device (the logical order must be preserved, however). The
dispatch table entries are :

   * `pl_MenuStr': Pointer to string that is printed in device menu.

   * `pl_DevName': A short device "name" for device selection by name.

   * `pl_type': 0 for file-oriented device, 1 for interactive (the null
     driver uses -1 here).

   * `pl_init': Initialize device. This routine may also prompt the user
     for certain device parameters or open a graphics file (see Notes).
     Called only once to set things up. Certain options such as
     familying and resolution (dots/mm) should be set up before calling
     this routine (note: some drivers ignore these).

   * `pl_line': Draws a line between two points.

   * `pl_polyline': Draws a polyline (no broken segments).

   * `pl_eop': Finishes out current page (see Notes).

   * `pl_bop': Set up for plotting on a new page. May also open a new a
     new graphics file (see Notes).

   * `pl_tidy': Tidy up. May close graphics file (see Notes).

   * `pl_state': Handle change in PLStream state (color, pen width,
     fill attribute, etc).

   * `pl_esc': Escape function for driver-specific commands.

Notes: Most devices allow multi-page plots to be stored in a single
graphics file, in which case the graphics file should be opened in the
pl_init() routine, closed in pl_tidy(), and page advances done by
calling pl_eop and pl_bop() in sequence. If multi-page plots need to be
stored in different files then pl_bop() should open the file and
pl_eop() should close it. Do NOT open files in both pl_init() and
pl_bop() or close files in both pl_eop() and pl_tidy(). It is
recommended that when adding new functions to only a certain driver,
the escape function be used. Otherwise it is necessary to add a null
routine to all the other drivers to handle the new function.

3.2.2 PLplot Metafiles and Plrender
-----------------------------------

The PLplot metafile is a way to store and transport your graphical data
for rendering at a later time or on a different system. A PLplot
metafile is in binary format in order to speed access and keep storage
costs reasonable. All data is stored in device-independent format
(written as a stream of bytes); the resulting file is about as portable
as a tektronix vector graphics file and only slightly larger.

   Each PLplot metafile begins with a header string that identifies it
as such, as well as the version number of the format since this may
change in time. The utility for rendering the metafile, `plrender',
verifies that the input file is indeed a valid PLplot metafile, and
that it understands the format the metafile is written in.  `plrender'
is part of the PLplot package and should be built at the time of
building PLplot, and then put into your search path. It is capable of
high speed rendering of the graphics file, especially if the output
device can accept commands at a high rate (e.g. X windows).

   The commands as written by the metafile driver at present are as
follows:

   * `INITIALIZE'

   * `CLOSE'

   * `SWITCH_TO_TEXT'

   * `SWITCH_TO_GRAPH'

   * `CLEAR'

   * `PAGE'

   * `NEW_COLOR'

   * `NEW_WIDTH'

   * `LINE'

   * `LINETO'

   * `ESCAPE'

   * `ADVANCE'

   Each command is written as a single byte, possibly followed by
additional data bytes. The `NEW_COLOR' and `NEW_WIDTH' commands each
write 2 data bytes, the `LINETO' command writes 4 data bytes, and the
`LINE' command writes 8 data bytes. The most common instruction in the
typical metafile will be the `LINETO' command, which draws a
continuation of the previous line to the given point.  This data
encoding is not quite as efficient as the tektronix format, which uses
4 bytes instead of 5 here (1 command `+' 4 data), however the PLplot
encoding is far simpler to implement and more robust. The `ESCAPE'
function writes a second command character (opcode) followed by an
arbitrary number of data bytes depending on the value of the opcode.
Note that any data written must be in device independent form to
maintain the transportability of the metafile so floating point numbers
are not allowed.

   The short usage message for `plrender' is printed if one inputs
insufficient or invalid arguments, and is as follows:


     % plrender

     No filename specified.

     Usage:
             plrender [options] [files]

     plrender options:

         -compression num     Sets compression level in supporting devices

   The options are generally self explanatory (family files are
explained in *Note Family File Output: Family File Output.).  Most of
these options have default values, and for those that don't `plrender'
will prompt the user. The `-px' and `-py' options are not so useful at
present, because everything is scaled down by the specified factor --
resulting in labels that are too small (future versions of `plrender'
might allow changing the label size as well).

   Additional options may be added in future releases.

3.2.3 Family File Output
------------------------

When sending PLplot to a file, the user has the option of generating a
family of output files for most output file drivers.  This can be
valuable when generating a large amount of output, so as to not strain
network or printer facilities by processing extremely large single
files. Each family member file can be treated as a completely
independent file. In addition, `plrender' has the ability to process a
set of family member files as a single logical file.

   To create a family file, one must simply call `plsfam' (*note
plsfam; Set family file parameters::) with the familying flag `fam' set
to 1, and the desired maximum member size (in bytes) in `bmax'.
`plsfam' (*note plsfam; Set family file parameters::) also allows you
to set the current family file number. If the current output driver
does not support familying, there will be no effect. This call must be
made before calling `plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::) or
`plstart' (*note plstart; Initialization::).

   If familying is enabled, the name given for the output file (on the
command line, in response to the `plstar' (*note plstar;
Initialization::) prompt, as a `plstart' (*note plstart;
Initialization::) argument, or as the result of a call to `plsfnam'
(*note plsfnam; Set output file name::)) becomes the name template for
the family. Thus, if you request a plmeta output file with name
`test-%n.plm', the files actually created will be `test-1.plm',
`test-2.plm', and so on, where `%n' indicates where the member number
is replaced.  If there is no `%n', then the output file becomes the
stem name and the created files will be like `test.plm.1',
`test.plm.2', and so on.  A new file is automatically started once the
byte limit for the current file is passed, but not until the next page
break. One may insure a new file at every page break by making the byte
limit small enough. Alternatively, if the byte limit is large you can
still insure a new file is automatically started after a page break if
you precede the call to `pleop' (*note pleop; Eject current page::)
with a call to `plfamadv' (*note plfamadv; Advance to the next family
file on the next new page::).

   The `plgfam' (*note plgfam; Get family file parameters::) routine
can be used from within the user program to find out more about the
graphics file being written. In particular, by periodically checking
the number of the member file currently being written to, one can
detect when a new member file is started. This information might be
used in various ways; for example you could spawn a process to
automatically plrender each metafile after it is closed (perhaps during
a long simulation run) and send it off to be printed.

   `plrender' has several options for dealing with family files. It can
process a single member file (`plrender' `test.plm.1') or the entire
family if given only the stem name (`plrender' `test.plm') It can also
create family files on output, rendering to any device that supports
familying, including another metafile if desired. The size of member
files in this case is input through the argument list, and defaults to
1MB if unspecified (this may be changed during the PLplot installation,
however). `plrender' can also create a single output file from a
familied input metafile.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Interactive Output Devices,  Next: Specifying the Output Device,  Prev: Family File Output,  Up: Output Devices

3.2.4 Interactive Output Devices
--------------------------------

Here we shall discuss briefly some of the more common interactive output
devices.

   Many popular terminals or terminal emulators at present have a
facility for switching between text and graphics screens.  This
includes the xterm emulator under X-windows, vt100's with
Retrographics, and numerous emulators for microcomputers which have a
dual vt100/tek4010 emulation capability. On these devices, it is
possible to switch between the text and graphics screens by surrounding
your PLplot calls by calls to `plgra' (*note plgra; Switch to graphics
screen::) and `pltext' (*note pltext; Switch to text screen::). This
will allow your diagnostic and informational code output to not
interfere with your graphical output.

   At present, only the xterm driver supports switching between text
and graphics screens. The escape sequences as sent by the xterm driver
are fairly standard, however, and have worked correctly on most other
popular vt100/tek4010 emulators we've tried.

   When using the xterm driver, hitting a RETURN will advance and clear
the page. If indeed running from an xterm, you may resize, move, cover
and uncover the window. The behavior of the X-window driver is quite
different, however. First, it is much faster, as there is no tty-like
handshaking going on. Second, a mouse click is used to advance and
clear the page, rather than a RETURN.

   On a tektronix 4014 compatible device, you may preview tektronix
output files via the `pltek' utility.  `pltek' will let you step
through the file interactively, skipping backward or forward if
desired. The help message for `pltek' is as follows:


     % pltek
     Usage: pltek filename
     At the prompt, the following replies are recognized:
        h,?    Give this help message.
         q     Quit program.
        <n>    Go to the specified page number.
        -<n>   Go back <n> pages.
        +<n>   Go forward <n> pages.
      <Return> Go to the next page.

The output device is switched to text mode before the prompt is given,
which causes the prompt to go to the vt102 window under xterm and most
vt100/tek4010 emulators.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Specifying the Output Device,  Prev: Interactive Output Devices,  Up: Output Devices

3.2.5 Specifying the Output Device
----------------------------------

The main initialization routine for PLplot is `plinit' (*note plinit;
Initialize PLplot::), which sets up all internal data structures
necessary for plotting and initializes the output device driver. The
output device can be a terminal, disk file, window system, pipe, or
socket. If the output device has not already been specified when
`plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) is called, a list of valid
output devices is given and the user is prompted for a choice. For
example:


     % x01c

     Plotting Options:
      < 1> xwin       X-Window (Xlib)
      < 2> tk         Tcl/TK Window
      < 3> xterm      Xterm Window
      < 4> tekt       Tektronix Terminal (4010)
      < 5> tek4107t   Tektronix Terminal (4105/4107)
      < 6> mskermit   MS-Kermit emulator
      < 7> versaterm  Versaterm vt100/tek emulator
      < 8> vlt        VLT vt100/tek emulator
      < 9> plmeta     PLPLOT Native Meta-File
      <10> tekf       Tektronix File (4010)
      <11> tek4107f   Tektronix File (4105/4107)
      <12> ps         PostScript File (monochrome)
      <13> psc        PostScript File (color)
      <14> xfig       Xfig file
      <15> ljiip      LaserJet IIp/deskjet compressed graphics
      <16> ljii       LaserJet II Bitmap File (150 dpi)
      <17> null       Null device

     Enter device number or keyword:

   Either the device number or a device keyword is accepted. Specifying
the device by keyword is preferable in aliases or scripts since the
device number is dependent on the install procedure (the installer can
choose which device drivers to include). The device can be specified
prior to the call to `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) by:

   * A call to `plsdev' (*note plsdev; Set the device [keyword] name::).

   * The `-dev' DEVICE command line argument, if the program's command
     line arguments are being passed to the PLplot function
     `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse command-line arguments::).

   Additional startup routines `plstar' (*note plstar;
Initialization::) and `plstart' (*note plstart; Initialization::) are
available but these are simply front-ends to `plinit' (*note plinit;
Initialize PLplot::), and should be avoided. It is preferable to call
`plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) directly, along with the
appropriate setup calls, for the greater amount of control this
provides (see the example programs for more info).

   Before `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) is called, you
may modify the number of subpages the output device is divided into via
a call to `plssub'. Subpages are useful for placing several graphs on a
page, but all subpages are constrained to be of the same size. For
greater flexibility, viewports can be used (see *Note Defining the
Viewport: Defining the Viewport. for more info on viewports). The
routine `pladv' (*note pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::) is used to
advance to a particular subpage or to the next subpage. The screen is
cleared (or a new piece of paper loaded) if a new subpage is requested
when there are no subpages left on the current page. When a page is
divided into subpages, the default character, symbol and tick sizes are
scaled inversely as the square root of the number of subpages in the
vertical direction. This is designed to improve readability of plot
labels as the plot size shrinks.

   PLplot has the ability to write to multiple output streams. An
output stream corresponds to a single logical device to which one plots
independent of all other streams. The function `plsstrm' (*note
plsstrm; Set current output stream::) is used to switch between streams
- you may only write to one output stream at a time. At present, an
output stream is not limited by the type of device, however, it may not
be wise to attempt opening two terminal devices. An example usage for
the creation of multiple streams is as follows:

     #include "plplot.h"

     main()
     {
         int nx = 2, ny = 2;

         plssub(nx, ny);
         plsdev("xwin");
         plinit();

         plots for stream 0

         plsstrm(1);
         plssub(nx, ny);
         plsdev("plmeta");
         plsfnam("tst.plm");
         plinit();

         plots for stream 1

         plsstrm(0);

         plots for stream 0

   and so on, for sending output simultaneously to an X-window and a
metafile. The default stream corresponds to stream number zero. At
present, the majority of output drivers can only be used by a single
stream (exceptions include the metafile driver and X-window driver).
Also see example program 14 (note: only the C version is available,
although it can be done equally well from Fortran).

   At the end of a plotting program, it is important to close the
plotting device by calling `plend' (*note plend; End plotting
session::). This flushes any internal buffers and frees any memory that
may have been allocated, for all open output streams. You may call
`plend1' (*note plend1; End plotting session for current stream::) to
close the plotting device for the current output stream only. Note that
if PLplot is initialized more than once during a program to change the
output device, an automatic call to `plend1' (*note plend1; End
plotting session for current stream::) is made before the new device is
opened for the given stream.

3.3 Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
=====================================================

Any bitmap driver in the PLplot family should be able to use fonts
(TrueType and others) that are rendered by the FreeType library just as
long as the device supports setting an individual pixel. Note that
drivers interact with FreeType using the support routines
`plD_FreeType_init', `plD_render_freetype_text', `plD_FreeType_Destroy',
`pl_set_extended_cmap0', and `pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer' that
are coded in `plfreetype.c'.

   The use of these support routines is exemplified by the `gd.c'
driver. Here we make some notes to accompany this driver which should
make it easier to migrate other drivers to use the FreeType library.
Every code fragment we mention below should be surrounded with a
`#ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE...#endif' to quarantine these fragments for
systems without the FreeType library. For interactive devices that need
caching of text drawing, reference should also be made to `wingcc.c'.

* Menu:

* Write a call back function to plot a single pixel::
* Initialise FreeType::
* Add A Command to redraw text [interactive drivers only]::
* Add Function Prototypes::
* Add Closing functions::


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Write a call back function to plot a single pixel,  Next: Initialise FreeType,  Up: Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers

3.3.1 Write a call back function to plot a single pixel
-------------------------------------------------------

First, write a call back function, of type `plD_pixel_fp', which
specifies how a single pixel is set in the current colour. This can be
of type static void. For example, in the `gd.c' driver it looks like
this:


     void plD_pixel_gd (PLStream *pls, short x, short y)
     {
     png_Dev *dev=(png_Dev *)pls->dev;

        gdImageSetPixel(dev->im_out, x, y,dev->colour);
     }


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Initialise FreeType,  Next: Add A Command to redraw text [interactive drivers only],  Prev: Write a call back function to plot a single pixel,  Up: Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers

3.3.2 Initialise FreeType
-------------------------

Next, we have to initialise the FreeType library. For the `gd.c' driver
this is done via two separate functions due to the order that dependent
information is initialised in the driver.

   The "level 1" initialisation of FreeType does two things: 1) calls
`plD_FreeType_init(pls)', which in turn allocates memory to the pls->FT
structure; and 2) stores the location of the call back routine.


     void init_freetype_lv1 (PLStream *pls)
     {
     FT_Data *FT;

     plD_FreeType_init(pls);

     FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;
     FT->pixel= (plD_pixel_fp)plD_pixel_gd;

     }

   This initialisation routine is called at the end of
`plD_init_png_Dev(PLStream *pls)' in the `gd.c' driver:


     if (freetype)
        {
         pls->dev_text = 1; /* want to draw text */
         init_freetype_lv1(pls);
         FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;
         FT->smooth_text=smooth_text;
        }

   `"freetype"' is a local variable which is parsed through
`plParseDrvOpts' to determine if the user wanted FreeType text. In that
case `pls->dev_text' is set to 1 to indicate the driver will be
rendering it's own text. After that, we always use `pls->dev_text' to
work out if we want FreeType or not.

   Similarly, `"smooth_text"' is a local variable passed through
`plParseDrvOpts' to find out if the user wants smoothing. Since there
is nothing in PLStream to track smoothing, we have to set the
FT->smooth_text flag as well at this time.

   The "level 2" initialisation function initialises everything else
required for using the FreeType library but has to be called after the
screen resolution and dpi have been set. Therefore, it is called at the
end of `plD_init_png()', where it looks like:


     if (pls->dev_text)
        {
         init_freetype_lv2(pls);
        }

   The actual function looks like this:


     static void init_freetype_lv2 (PLStream *pls)
     {
     png_Dev *dev=(png_Dev *)pls->dev;
     FT_Data *FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;

     FT->scale=dev->scale;
     FT->ymax=dev->pngy;
     FT->invert_y=1;

     if (FT->smooth_text==1)
        {
         FT->ncol0_org=pls->ncol0;                                   /* save a copy of the original size of ncol0 */
         FT->ncol0_xtra=NCOLOURS-(pls->ncol1+pls->ncol0);            /* work out how many free slots we have */
         FT->ncol0_width=FT->ncol0_xtra/(pls->ncol0-1);              /* find out how many different shades of anti-aliasing we can do */
         if (FT->ncol0_width>64) FT->ncol0_width=64;                 /* set a maximum number of shades */
         plscmap0n(FT->ncol0_org+(FT->ncol0_width*pls->ncol0));      /* redefine the size of cmap0 */
     /* the level manipulations are to turn off the plP_state(PLSTATE_CMAP0)
      * call in plscmap0 which (a) leads to segfaults since the GD image is
      * not defined at this point and (b) would be inefficient in any case since
      * setcmap is always called later (see plD_bop_png) to update the driver
      * color palette to be consistent with cmap0. */
         {
            PLINT level_save;
            level_save = pls->level;
            pls->level = 0;
            pl_set_extended_cmap0(pls, FT->ncol0_width, FT->ncol0_org); /* call the function to add the extra cmap0 entries and calculate stuff */
            pls->level = level_save;
         }
        }

     }

   FT->scale is a scaling factor to convert coordinates. This is used by
the `gd.c' and some other drivers to scale back a larger virtual page
and this eliminate the "hidden line removal bug". Set it to 1 if your
device driver doesn't use any scaling.

   Some coordinate systems have zero on the bottom, others have zero on
the top. FreeType does it one way, and most everything else does it the
other. To make sure everything is working ok, we have to "flip" the
coordinates, and to do this we need to know how big in the Y dimension
the page is, and whether we have to invert the page or leave it alone.

   * FT->ymax specifies the size of the page

   * FT->invert_y=1 tells us to invert the y-coordinates,
     FT->invert_y=0 will not invert the coordinates.

   We also do some computational gymnastics to "expand" cmap0 if the
user wants anti-aliased text. Basically, you have to work out how many
spare colours there are in the driver after cmap0 and cmap1 are done,
then set a few variables in FT to let the render know how many colours
it's going to have at its disposal, and call plscmap0n to resize cmap0.
The call to `pl_set_extended_cmap0' does the remaining part of the
work. Note it essential to protect that call by the `pls->level'
manipulations for the reasons stated.

3.3.3 Add A Command to redraw text (interactive drivers only)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Plplot only caches drawing commands, not text plotting commands, so for
interactive devices which refresh their display by replaying the plot
buffer, a separate function has to be called to redraw the text.
plfreetype knows when buffering is being used by a device driver, and
will automatically start caching text when necessary. To redraw this
cached text, a call to `pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer' has to be
added after the driver has called `plRemakePlot'. The following example
is from `wingcc.c'.


                     if (dev->waiting==1)
                     {
                         plRemakePlot(pls);
                         #ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE
                         pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer(pls);
                         #endif
                      }

Next, to the top of the drivers' source file add the prototype
definitions for the functions just written.


     static void plD_pixel_gd (PLStream *pls, short x, short y);

3.3.5 Add Closing functions
---------------------------

Finally, add a `plD_FreeType_Destroy(pls)' entry to the device "tidy"
function; this command deallocates memory allocated to the FT entry in
the stream, closes the FreeType library and any open fonts. It is also
a good idea to reset CMAP0 back to it's original size here if
anti-aliasing was done. For example, in the `gd.c' driver, it looks
like this:


     void plD_tidy_png(PLStream *pls)
     {
        fclose(pls->OutFile);

     #ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE
        FT_Data *FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;

3.4 View Surfaces, (Sub-)Pages, Viewports and Windows
=====================================================

There is a whole hierarchy of coordinate systems associated with any
PLplot graph. At the lowest level a device provides a view surface
(coordinates in mm's) which can be a terminal screen or a sheet of paper
in the output device. `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) or
`plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::) (or `plstart' (*note plstart;
Initialization::)) makes that device view surface accessible as a page
or divided up into sub-pages (see `plssub' (*note plssub; Set the
number of subpages in x and y::)) which are accessed with `pladv'
(*note pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::). Before a graph can be drawn
for a subpage, the program must call appropriate routines in PLplot to
define the viewport for the subpage and a window for the viewport. A
viewport is a rectangular region of the subpage which is specified in
normalized subpage coordinates or millimetres. A window is a
rectangular region of world-coordinate space which is mapped directly
to its viewport. (When drawing a graph, the programmer usually wishes
to specify the coordinates of the points to be plotted in terms of the
values of the variables involved. These coordinates are called world
coordinates, and may have any floating-point value representable by the
computer.)

   Although the usual choice is to have one viewport per subpage, and
one window per viewport, each subpage can have more than one (possibly
overlapping) viewport defined, and each viewport can have more than one
window (more than one set of world coordinates) defined.

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Defining the Viewport,  Next: Defining the Window,  Up: View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows

3.4.1 Defining the Viewport
---------------------------

After defining the view surface and subpage with the appropriate call
to `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) or `plstar' (*note
plstar; Initialization::) (or `plstart' (*note plstart;
Initialization::)) and a call to `pladv' (*note pladv; Advance the
[sub-]page::) it is necessary to define the portion of this subpage
which is to be used for plotting the graph (the viewport). All lines
and symbols (except for labels drawn by `plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a
box with axes; etc::), `plmtex' (*note plmtex; Write text relative to
viewport boundaries::) and `pllab' (*note pllab; Simple routine to
write labels::)) are clipped at the viewport boundaries.

   Viewports are created within the current subpage. If the division of
the output device into equally sized subpages is inappropriate, it is
best to specify only a single subpage which occupies the entire output
device (by using `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) or by
setting `nx = 1' and `ny = 1' in `plstar' (*note plstar;
Initialization::) or `plstart' (*note plstart; Initialization::)), and
use one of the viewport specification subroutines below to place the
plot in the desired position on the page.

   There are four methods for specifying the viewport size, using the
subroutines `plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify viewport using
coordinates::), `plsvpa' (*note plsvpa; Specify viewport in absolute
coordinates::), `plvasp' (*note plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect
ratio only::), and `plvpas' (*note plvpas; Specify viewport using
coordinates and aspect ratio::) which are called like this:

         plvpor(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
         plsvpa(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
         plvasp(aspect);
         plvpas(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, aspect);

   where in the case of `plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify viewport using
coordinates::) and `plvpas' (*note plvpas; Specify viewport using
coordinates and aspect ratio::), the arguments are given in normalized
subpage coordinates which are defined to run from 0.0 to 1.0 along each
edge of the subpage. Thus for example,

         plvpor(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);

   uses the top left quarter of the current subpage.

   In order to get a graph of known physical size, the routine `plsvpa'
(*note plsvpa; Specify viewport in absolute coordinates::) defines the
viewport in terms of absolute coordinates (millimeters) measured from
the bottom left-hand corner of the current subpage.  This routine
should only be used when the size of the view surface is known, and a
definite scaling is required.

   The routine `plvasp' (*note plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect
ratio only::) gives the largest viewport with the given aspect ratio
that fits in the current subpage (i.e. the ratio of the length of the y
axis to that of the x axis is equal to `aspect'). It also allocates
space on the left and top of the viewport for labels.

   The routine `plvpas' (*note plvpas; Specify viewport using
coordinates and aspect ratio::) gives the largest viewport with the
given aspect ratio that fits in the specified region (specified with
normalized subpage coordinates, as with `plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify
viewport using coordinates::)). This routine is functionally equivalent
to `plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates::) when a
natural aspect ratio is chosen (done by setting `aspect' to 0.0). Unlike
`plvasp' (*note plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only::),
this routine reserves no extra space at the edges for labels.

   To help the user call `plsvpa' (*note plsvpa; Specify viewport in
absolute coordinates::) correctly, the routine `plgspa' (*note plgspa;
Get current subpage parameters::) is provided which returns the
positions of the extremities of the current subpage measured in
millimeters from the bottom left-hand corner of the device. Thus, if to
set up a viewport with a 10.0 mm margin around it within the current
subpage, the following sequence of calls may be used:

         plgspa(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
         plsvpa(10.0, xmax-xmin-10.0, 10.0, ymax-ymin-10.0);

   A further routine `plvsta' (*note plvsta; Select standard
viewport::) is available which sets up a standard viewport within the
current subpage with suitable margins on each side of the viewport.
This may be used for simple graphs, as it leaves enough room for axis
labels and a title. This standard viewport is that used by `plenv'
(*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::) (See *Note Setting
up a Standard Window: Setting up a Standard Window.).

   Another way to get a specified aspect ratio is via the routine
`plsasp' [not!.. fix this], which sets the global aspect ratio and must
be called prior to `plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::). An aspect
ratio of 0.0 corresponds to natural dimensions (i.e. fill the page);
any positive value will give the specified aspect ratio.  This scaling
of plots is actually done in the driver, and so may not work for all
output devices (note that `plrender' is capable of scaled aspect ratio
plots to any device whether that device supports scaling or not). In
such scaled plots, absolute plotting is done in the scaled coordinate
system.

3.4.2 Defining the Window
-------------------------

The window must be defined after the viewport in order to map the world
coordinate rectangle into the viewport rectangle. The routine `plwind'
(*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries::) is
used to specify the rectangle in world-coordinate space.  For example,
if we wish to plot a graph showing the collector current I_C as a
function of the collector to emitter voltage V_CE for a transistor
where 0 <= I_C <= 10.0 mA and 0 <= V_CE <= 12.0 V, we would call the
function `plwind' (*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport
boundaries::) as follows:

         plwind(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0);

   Note that each of the arguments is a floating point number, and so
the decimal points are required. If the order of either the X limits or
Y limits is reversed, the corresponding axis will point in the opposite
sense, (i.e., right to left for X and top to bottom for Y).  The window
must be defined before any calls to the routines which actually draw
the data points. Note however that `plwind' (*note plwind; Specify
world coordinates of viewport boundaries::) may also be called to
change the window at any time. This will affect the appearance of
objects drawn later in the program, and is useful for drawing two or
more graphs with different axes on the same piece of paper.

3.4.3 Annotating the Viewport
-----------------------------

The routine `plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::) is used
to specify whether a frame is drawn around the viewport and to control
the positions of the axis subdivisions and numeric labels. For our
simple graph of the transistor characteristics, we may wish to draw a
frame consisting of lines on all four sides of the viewport, and to
place numeric labels along the bottom and left hand side. We can also
tell PLplot to choose a suitable tick interval and the number of
subticks between the major divisions based upon the data range
specified to `plwind' (*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of
viewport boundaries::).  This is done using the following statement

         plbox("bcnst", 0.0, 0, "bcnstv", 0.0, 0);

   The lengths of major and minor ticks on the axes are set up by the
routines `plsmaj' (*note plsmaj; Set length of major ticks::) and
`plsmin' (*note plsmin; Set length of minor ticks::).

   Another routine `pllab' (*note pllab; Simple routine to write
labels::) provides for text labels for the bottom, left hand side and
top of the viewport. These labels are not clipped, even though they lie
outside the viewport (but they are clipped at the subpage boundaries).
`pllab' (*note pllab; Simple routine to write labels::) actually calls
the more general routine `plmtex' (*note plmtex; Write text relative to
viewport boundaries::) which can be used for plotting labels at any
point relative to the viewport. For our example, we may use

         pllab("V#dCE#u (Volts)", "I#dC#u (mA)", "TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS");

   Note that `#d' and `#u' are escape sequences (see *Note Escape
sequences in text: Escape sequences in text.) which allow subscripts
and superscripts to be used in text. They are described more fully
later in this chapter.

   The appearance of axis labels may be further altered by auxiliary
calls to `plprec' (*note plprec; Set precision in numeric labels::),
`plschr' (*note plschr; Set character size::), `plsxax' (*note plsxax;
Set x axis parameters::), `plsyax' (*note plsyax; Set y axis
parameters::), and `plszax' (*note plszax; Set z axis parameters::). The
routine `plprec' (*note plprec; Set precision in numeric labels::) is
used to set the number of decimal places precision for axis labels,
while `plschr' (*note plschr; Set character size::) modifies the
heights of characters used for the axis and graph labels. Routines
`plsxax' (*note plsxax; Set x axis parameters::), `plsyax' (*note
plsyax; Set y axis parameters::), and `plszax' (*note plszax; Set z
axis parameters::) are used to modify the `digmax' setting for each
axis, which affects how floating point labels are formatted.

   The `digmax' variable represents the maximum field width for the
numeric labels on an axis (ignored if less than one).  If the numeric
labels as generated by PLplot exceed this width, then PLplot
automatically switches to floating point representation. In this case
the exponent will be placed at the top left for a vertical axis on the
left, top right for a vertical axis on the right, and bottom right for
a horizontal axis.

   For example, let's suppose that we have set `digmax = 5' via
`plsyax' (*note plsyax; Set y axis parameters::), and for our plot a
label is generated at `y = 0.0000478'. In this case the actual field
width is longer than `digmax', so PLplot switches to floating point. In
this representation, the label is printed as simply 4.78 with the 10^-5
exponent placed separately.

   The determination of maximum length (i.e. `digmax') for fixed point
quantities is complicated by the fact that long fixed point
representations look much worse than the same sized floating point
representation. Further, a fixed point number with magnitude much less
than one will actually gain in precision when written as floating
point. There is some compensation for this effect built into PLplot,
thus the internal representation for number of digits kept (`digfix')
may not always match the user's specification (via `digmax'). However,
it will always be true that `digfix <= digmax'. The PLplot defaults are
set up such that good results are usually obtained without user
intervention.

   Finally, after the call to `plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a box with
axes; etc::), the user may call routines `plgxax' (*note plgxax; Get x
axis parameters::), `plgyax' (*note plgyax; Get y axis parameters::),
or `plgzax' (*note plgzax; Get z axis parameters::) to obtain
information about the window just drawn. This can be helpful when
deciding where to put captions. For example, a typical usage would be
to call `plgyax' (*note plgyax; Get y axis parameters::) to get the
value of `digits', then offset the y axis caption by that amount (plus
a bit more) so that the caption floats just to the outside of the
numeric labels.  Note that the `digits' value for each axis for the
current plot is not correct until after the call to `plbox' (*note
plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::) is complete.

3.4.4 Setting up a Standard Window
----------------------------------

Having to call `pladv' (*note pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::),
`plvpor' (*note plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates::), `plwind'
(*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries::) and
`plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::) is excessively
cumbersome for drawing simple graphs. Subroutine `plenv' (*note plenv;
Set up standard window and draw box::) combines all four of these in
one subroutine, using the standard viewport, and a limited subset of
the capabilities of `plbox' (*note plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::).
For example, the graph described above could be initiated by the call:

         plenv(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0, 0, 0);

   which is equivalent to the following series of calls:

         pladv(0);
         plvsta();
         plwind(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0);
         plbox("bcnst", 0.0, 0, "bcnstv", 0.0, 0);


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Setting Line Attributes,  Next: Setting the Area Fill Pattern,  Prev: View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows,  Up: Advanced Use of PLplot

3.5 Setting Line Attributes
===========================

The graph drawing routines may be freely mixed with those described in
this section, allowing the user to control line color, width and
styles. The attributes set up by these routines apply modally, i.e, all
subsequent objects (lines, characters and symbols) plotted until the
next change in attributes are affected in the same way. The only
exception to this rule is that characters and symbols are not affected
by a change in the line style, but are always drawn using a continuous
line.

   Line color is set using the routine `plcol0' (*note plcol0; Set
color; map0::). The argument is ignored for devices which can only plot
in one color, although some terminals support line erasure by plotting
in color zero.

   Line width is set using `plwid' (*note plwid; Set pen width::). This
option is not supported by all devices.

   Line style is set using the routine `plstyl' (*note plstyl; Set line
style::) or `pllsty' (*note pllsty; Select line style::). A broken line
is specified in terms of a repeated pattern consisting of marks (pen
down) and spaces (pen up). The arguments to this routine are the number
of elements in the line, followed by two pointers to integer arrays
specifying the mark and space lengths in micrometers.  Thus a line
consisting of long and short dashes of lengths 4 mm and 2 mm, separated
by spaces of length 1.5 mm is specified by:

         mark[0] = 4000;
         mark[1] = 2000;
         space[0] = 1500;
         space[1] = 1500;
         plstyl(2, mark, space);

   To return to a continuous line, just call `plstyl' (*note plstyl;
Set line style::) with first argument set to zero. You can use `pllsty'
(*note pllsty; Select line style::) to choose between 8 different
predefined styles.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Setting the Area Fill Pattern,  Next: Setting Color,  Prev: Setting Line Attributes,  Up: Advanced Use of PLplot

3.6 Setting the Area Fill Pattern
=================================

The routine `plpat' (*note plpat; Set area fill pattern::) can be used
to set the area fill pattern. The pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of
parallel lines with specified inclinations and spacings. The arguments
to this routine are the number of sets to use (1 or 2) followed by two
pointers to integer arrays (of 1 or 2 elements) specifying the
inclinations in tenths of a degree and the spacing in micrometers (the
inclination should be between -900 and 900). Thus to specify an area
fill pattern consisting of horizontal lines spaced 2 mm apart use:

         *inc = 0;
         *del = 2000;
         plpat(1, inc, del);

   To set up a symmetrical crosshatch pattern with lines directed 30
degrees above and below the horizontal and spaced 1.5 mm apart use:

         *inc = 300;
         *(inc+1) = -300;
         *del = 1500;
         *(del+1) = 1500;
         plpat(2, inc, del);

   The routine `plpsty' (*note plpsty; Select area fill pattern::) can
be used to select from 1 of 8 predefined patterns.

   The area fill routines also use the current line style, width and
colors to give a virtually infinite number of different patterns.

3.7 Setting Color
=================

Normally, color is used for all drivers and devices that support it
within PLplot subject to the condition that the user has the option of
globally turning off the color (and subsequently turning it on again if
so desired) using `plscolor' (*note plscolor; Used to globally turn
color output on/off::).

   The PLplot color model utilizes two color maps which can be used
interchangeably. However, color map0 (discussed in *Note Color Map0:
Color Map0.) has discrete colors with no particular order and is most
suited to coloring the background, axes, lines, and labels, and color
map1 (discussed in *Note Color Map1: Color Map1.) has continuously
changing colors and is most suited to plots (see *Note Contour and
Shade Plots: Contour and Shade Plots.) in which data values are
represented by colors.

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Color Map0,  Next: Color Map1,  Up: Setting Color

3.7.1 Color Map0
----------------

Color map0 is most suited to coloring the background, axes, lines, and
labels. Generally, the default color map0 palette of 16 colors is used.
(`examples/c/x02c.c' illustrates these colors.) The default background
color is taken from the index 0 color which is black by default. The
default foreground color is red.

   There are a number of options for changing the default red on black
colors. The user may set the index 0 background color using the
command-line `bg' parameter or by calling `plscolbg' (*note plscolbg;
Set the background color by 8-bit RGB value::) (or `plscol0' (*note
plscol0; Set a given color from color map0 by 8 bit RGB value::) with a
0 index) before `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::).  During
the course of the plot, the user can change the foreground color as
often as desired using `plcol0' (*note plcol0; Set color; map0::) to
select the index of the desired color.

   For more advanced use it is possible to define an arbitrary map0
palette of colors. The user may set the number of colors in the map0
palette using the command-line `ncol0' parameter or by calling
`plscmap0n' (*note plscmap0n; Set number of colors in color map0::).
`plscol0' (*note plscol0; Set a given color from color map0 by 8 bit
RGB value::) sets the RGB value of the given index which must be less
than the maximum number of colors (which is set by default, by command
line, by `plscmap0n' (*note plscmap0n; Set number of colors in color
map0::), or even by `plscmap0' (*note plscmap0; Set color map0 colors
by 8-bit RGB values::)).  Alternatively, `plscmap0' (*note plscmap0;
Set color map0 colors by 8-bit RGB values::) sets up the entire map0
color palette. For all these ways of defining the map0 palette any
number of colors are allowed in any order, but it is not guaranteed
that the individual drivers will actually be able to use more than 16
colors.

3.7.2 Color Map1
----------------

Color map1 is most suited to plots (see *Note Contour and Shade Plots:
Contour and Shade Plots.) in which data values are represented by
colors. The data are scaled to the input map1 range of floating point
numbers between 0. and 1. which in turn are mapped (using `plcol1'
(*note plcol1; Set color; map1::)) to colors using a default or
user-specified map1 color transformation. Thus, there are calls to
`plcol1' (*note plcol1; Set color; map1::) from within the code for
`plshade' (*note plshade; Shade individual region on the basis of
value::) (see `src/plshade.c') and `plsurf3d' (*note plsurf3d; Plot
shaded 3-d surface plot::) (see `src/plot3d.c') to give a continuous
range of color corresponding to the data being plotted. In addition
`plcol1' (*note plcol1; Set color; map1::) can be used to specify the
foreground color using the map1 continuous color palette (see the
commented out section of `examples/c/x12c.c' which gives an example of
this for a histogram), but normally `plcol0' (*note plcol0; Set color;
map0::) is a better tool for this job (see *Note Color Map0: Color
Map0.) since discrete colors often give a better-looking result.

   For more advanced use it is possible to define an arbitrary map1
palette of colors. The user may set the number of colors in this palette
using the command-line `ncol1' parameter or by calling `plscmap1n'
(*note plscmap1n; Set number of colors in color map1::). Furthermore,
`plscmap1l' (*note plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise
linear relationship::) can be used to set the map1 color palette using
linear interpolation between control points specified in either RGB or
HLS space.

   There is a one-to-one correspondence between RGB and HLS color
spaces. RGB space is characterized by three 8-bit unsigned integers
corresponding to the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. Thus,
in hexidecimal notation with the 3 bytes concatanated together the RGB
values of FF0000, FFFF00, 00FF00, 00FFFF, 0000FF, FF00FF, 000000, and
FFFFFF correspond to red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, black, and
white.

   HLS (hue, lightness, and saturation) space is often conceptually
easier to use than RGB space. One useful way to visualize HLS space is
as a volume made up by two cones with their bases joined at the
equator. A given RGB point corresponds to HLS point somewhere on or
inside the double cones, and vice versa. The hue corresponds to the
longitude of the point with 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees
corresponding to red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta. The
lightness corresponds to the distance along the axis of the figure of a
perpendicular dropped from the HLS point to the axis. This values
ranges from 0 at the south pole to 1 at the north pole. The saturation
corresponds to the distance of the HLS point from the axis with the
on-axis value being 0 and the surface value being 1. Full saturation
corresponds to full color while reducing the saturation (moving toward
the axis of the HLS figure) mixes more gray into the color until at
zero saturation on the axis of the figure you have only shades of gray
with the variation of lightness along the axis corresponding to a gray
scale.

   Here are some C-code fragments which use `plscmap1l' (*note
plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear
relationship::) to set the map1 color palette. This first example
illustrates how to set up a gray-scale pallette using linear
interpolation in RGB space.

         i[0] = 0.;
         i[1] = 1.;
         /* RGB are rescaled to the range from 0 to 1. for input to plscmap1l.*/
         r[0] = 0.;
         r[1] = 1.;
         g[0] = 0.;
         g[1] = 1.;
         b[0] = 0.;
         b[1] = 1.;
         plscmap1l(1, 2, i, r, g, b, NULL);

   This second example illustrates doing the same thing in HLS space.

         i[0] = 0.;
         i[1] = 1.;
         /* Hue does not matter for zero saturation.*/
         h[0] = 0.;
         h[1] = 0.;
         /* Lightness varies through its full range.*/
         l[0] = 0.;
         l[1] = 1.;
         /* Saturation is zero for a gray scale.*/
         s[0] = 0.;
         s[1] = 0.;
         /* Note the first argument which specifies HLS space.*/
         plscmap1l(0, 2, i, h, l, s, NULL);

   This final example using `plscmap1l' (*note plscmap1l; Set color
map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship::) illustrates how
the default map1 color pallette is set with just 4 control points
(taken from `src/plctrl.c').

     /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*\
      * plcmap1_def()
      *
      * Initializes color map 1.
      *
      * The default initialization uses 4 control points in HLS space, the two
      * inner ones being very close to one of the vertices of the HLS double

      * the background color.  If you don't like these settings you can always
      * initialize it yourself.
     \*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

     static void
     plcmap1_def(void)
     {
         PLFLT i[4], h[4], l[4], s[4], vertex = 0.;

     /* Positions of control points */

         i[0] = 0;		/* left boundary */
         i[1] = 0.45;	/* just before center */
         i[2] = 0.55;	/* just after center */
         i[3] = 1;		/* right boundary */

     /* For center control points, pick black or white, whichever is closer to bg */
     /* Be carefult to pick just short of top or bottom else hue info is lost */

         if (plsc->cmap0 != NULL)
     	vertex = ((float) plsc->cmap0[0].r +
     		  (float) plsc->cmap0[0].g +
     		  (float) plsc->cmap0[0].b) / 3. / 255.;

         if (vertex < 0.5)
     	vertex = 0.01;
         else
     	vertex = 0.99;

     /* Set hue */

         h[0] = 260;		/* low: blue-violet */
         h[1] = 260;		/* only change as we go over vertex */
         h[2] = 0;		/* high: red */
         h[3] = 0;		/* keep fixed */

     /* Set lightness */

         l[0] = 0.5;		/* low */
         l[1] = vertex;	/* bg */
         l[2] = vertex;	/* bg */
         l[3] = 0.5;		/* high */

     /* Set saturation -- keep at maximum */

         s[0] = 1;
         s[1] = 1;
         s[2] = 1;
         s[3] = 1;

         c_plscmap1l(0, 4, i, h, l, s, NULL);
     }

   Finally, `plscmap1' (*note plscmap1; Set color map1 colors using
8-bit RGB values::) is an additional method of setting the map1 color
palette directly using RGB space. No interpolation is used with
`plscmap1' (*note plscmap1; Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB
values::) so it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure that
the colors vary smoothly. Here is an example of the method taken from
`examples/c/x08c.c' which sets (yet again) the gray-scale color
pallette.

         for (i=0;i<n_col;i++)
             rr[i] = gg[i] = bb[i] = i*256/n_col;
         plscmap1(rr,gg,bb,n_col);

3.8 Setting Character Attributes
================================

Plplot uses two separate font systems to display characters. The
traditional system uses Hershey fonts which are available for all
device drivers, while the recently introduced unicode system is
currently available only for the ps, psc, png, jpeg, and gif devices.
For details on how to enable the unicode font system for additional
device drivers using the FreeType library, see *Note Adding FreeType
Library Support to Bitmap Drivers: Adding FreeType Library Support to
Bitmap Drivers..

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Hershey fonts,  Next: Unicode fonts,  Up: Setting Character Attributes

3.8.1 Hershey fonts
-------------------

There are two Hershey font character sets included with PLplot.  These
are known as the standard and extended character sets. The standard
character set is a subset of the extended set. It contains 177
characters including the ascii characters in a normal style font, the
Greek alphabet and several plotter symbols. The extended character set
contains almost 1000 characters, including four font styles, and
several math, musical and plotter symbols.

   The extended character set is loaded into memory automatically when
`plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::) or `plstart' (*note plstart;
Initialization::) is called. The standard character set is loaded by
calling `plfontld' (*note plfontld; Load character font::). The
extended character set requires about 50 KBytes of memory, versus about
5 KBytes for the standard set. `plfontld' (*note plfontld; Load
character font::) can be used to switch between the extended and
standard sets (one set is unloaded before the next is loaded).
`plfontld' (*note plfontld; Load character font::) can be called before
`plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::).

   When the extended character set is loaded there are four different
font styles to choose from. In this case, the routine `plfont' (*note
plfont; Set character font::) sets up the default Hershey font for all
character strings. It may be overridden for any portion of a string by
using an escape sequence within the text, as described below. This
routine has no effect when the standard font set is loaded. The default
font (1) is simple and fastest to draw; the others are useful for
presentation plots on a high-resolution device.

   The font codes are interpreted as follows:

   * `font = 1': normal (sans-serif) font

   * `font = 2': roman (serif) font

   * `font = 3': italic font

   * `font = 4': script font

3.8.2 Unicode fonts
-------------------

The advantages of the unicode fonts over the more traditional PLplot
Hershey fonts are the availability of many additional glyphs (including
mathematical symbols and glyphs from other than western-European
languages) and much better display of characters on computer screens
using anti-aliasing and hinting. Unicode fonts are obtained by
specifying a command-line option of -drvopt text for the devices
(currently ps, psc, png, jpeg, gif, gcw, and wingcc) where it has been
implemented.

   For the ps and psc devices, there is a fixed relationship between the
FCI (font characterization integer, see *Note FCI: FCI.)  and the
actual Type 1 fonts that are being used. This fixed relationship is
specified in the Type1Lookup array in include/plfci.h. This array maps
the font-family attributes of sans-serif, serif, monotype, script, and
symbol to the standard postscript font families called Helvetica,
Times-Roman, Courier, Times-Roman, and Symbol. (There is no script font
family amongst the 35 standard Type 1 postscript fonts so that is why
we map the font-family attribute of script to Times-Roman.)  Similarly,
this array maps the font-style attributes of upright, italic or oblique
and the font-weight attributes of medium or bold to the appropriate
variety of the Helvetica, Times-Roman, Courier, and Symbol font
families that are part of the 35 standard Type 1 postscript fonts.
These standard postscript fonts are normally installed on a user's
system using the gsfonts package.

   For the devices handled by the FreeType library (currently png, jpeg,
and gif) there is a configurable relationship between the FCI (font
characterization integer, see *Note FCI: FCI.)  and the TrueType fonts
that are actually used.

   On Unix/Linux systems, the TrueType fonts corresponding to the 30
possible valid FCIs can be specified using ./configure options. (Use
./configure -help to see the possibilities and also the default values
for the fonts.) These ./configure defaults for the 30 possibilites are
taken from fonts available from the ttf-freefont font package. We
recommend this font package because it has a rather complete set of
glyphs for most unicode blocks. (We also recommend the gucharmap
application for determining other unicode font possibilities on your
system that are available via the FreeType library.)

   On Windows systems, the fixed default TrueType fonts are specified
in the include/plfci.h file. (NOT PROGRAMMED YET, so this statement
will probably NEED REVISION.)

   For all systems, the 30 possible TrueType fonts can be specified at
run time using the following environment variables:

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_BOLD_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_BOLD_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_BOLD_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_BOLD_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_BOLD_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_BOLD_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_BOLD_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_BOLD_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_BOLD_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_BOLD_ITALIC_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SANS_BOLD_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SERIF_BOLD_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_MONO_BOLD_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SCRIPT_BOLD_OBLIQUE_FONT

   * PLPLOT_FREETYPE_SYMBOL_BOLD_OBLIQUE_FONT

On Unix/Linux systems if these environment variables are not specified
with an absolute path starting with "/", then the absolute path is
specified by the configured default (see ./configure -help) or at run
time with the environment variable PLPLOT_FREETYPE_FONT_DIR.

3.8.3 FCI
---------

We specify the properties of unicode fonts with the FCI (font
characterization integer). The FCI is a 32-bit unsigned integer whose
most significant hexadecimal digit is marked with an 0x8 (0x80000000 is
ORed with the FCI value to mark it) to distinguish it from a unicode
(UCS4) integer (whose maximum value 0x7fffffff). Users obtain the
current FCI by calling `plgfci' (*note plgfci; Get FCI [font
characterization integer]::) and store a new FCI to be used at the
start of each subsequent string using `plsfci' (*note plsfci; Set FCI
[font characterization integer]::). Independent hexadecimal values
within the FCI are characterized by the hexdigit and hexpower. The
hexpower is defined as the power of 16 or number of hexadecimal places
to the left of the "decimal place" in the FCI where the hexdigit is
stored. The interpretation of the hexdigit and hexpower values in the
FCI are given in *Note FCI interpretation: FCI interpretation..



   *FCI interpretation*

           hexdigit   0          1          2          3          4
           ->                                                     
Font       hexpower                                               
attribute                                                         
font-family0          sans-serif serif      monospace  script     symbol
font-style 1          upright    italic     oblique               
font-weight2          medium     bold                             

   Note the maximum value of hexdigit is 7 and the maximum value of
hexpower is 6 so there is substantial room for expansion of this
scheme. On the other hand, since each font attribute is independent of
the rest, what is implemented now gives us a maximum of 30 different
font possibilities which is probably more than enough for most plotting
purposes.

3.8.4 Escape sequences in text
------------------------------

The routines which draw text all allow you to include escape sequences
in the text to be plotted. These are character sequences that are
interpreted as instructions to change fonts, draw superscripts and
subscripts, draw non-ASCII (e.g. Greek), and so on.  All escape
sequences start with a number symbol (`#') by default. Some language
interfaces have the capability of changing this default, but we will
assume (`#') in the remaining documentation of the escape sequences.

   The following escape sequences are defined:

   * `#u': move up to the superscript position (ended with `#d')

   * `#d': move down to subscript position (ended with `#u')

   * `#b': backspace (to allow overprinting)

   * `##': number symbol

   * `#+': toggle overline mode

   * `#-': toggle underline mode

   * `#gx': Greek letter corresponding to Roman letter `x' (see below)

   * `#fn': switch to normal (sans-serif) font

   * `#fr': switch to Roman (serif) font

   * `#fi': switch to italic font

   * `#fs': switch to script font

   * `#(nnn)': Hershey character nnn (1 to 4 decimal digits)

   * `#[nnn]': unicode character nnn (nnn can be decimal or hexadecimal
     [e.g., starting with 0x]) (UNICODE ONLY).

   * `#<0x8nnnnnnn>': absolute FCI to be used to change fonts in
     mid-string. (nnnnnnn must be exactly 7 digits). (UNICODE ONLY).

   * `#<0xmn>': change just one attribute of the FCI in mid-string
     where m is the hexdigit and n is the hexpower. If more than two
     digits are given (so long as the eigth digit does not mark this as
     an absolute FCI, see above) they are ignored. (UNICODE ONLY).

   * `#<FCI COMMAND STRING/>': the FCI COMMAND STRING is currently one
     of "sans-serif", "serif", "monospace", "script", "symbol",
     "upright", "italic", "oblique" "medium", or "bold" (without the
     surrounding quotes). These FCI COMMAND STRINGS change one
     attribute of the FCI according to their name. (UNICODE ONLY).

   Sections of text can have an underline or overline appended. For
example, the string S-freq is obtained by specifying
`"#+S#+(#-freq#-)"'.

   Greek letters are obtained by `#g' followed by a Roman letter. *Note
Roman Characters Corresponding to Greek Characters: Roman Characters
Corresponding to Greek Characters. shows how these letters map into
Greek characters.



   *Roman Characters Corresponding to Greek Characters*

Greek  nu     xi     omicronpi     rho    sigma  tau    upsilonphi    chi    psi    omega

   The escape sequences `#fn', `#fr', `#fi', `#fs', and `#(nnn)' are
designed for the four Hershey fonts, but an effort has been made to
allow some limited forward compatibility so these escape sequences have
a reasonable result when unicode fonts are being used. However, for
maximum flexibility when using unicode fonts, these 5 escape sequences
should be replaced by using the 4 escape sequences `#[nnn]',
`#<0x8nnnnnnn>', `#<0xmn>', or `#<FCI COMMAND STRING/>' as appropriate.

3.8.5 Character size adjustment
-------------------------------

The routine `plschr' (*note plschr; Set character size::) is used to
set up the size of subsequent characters drawn. The actual height of a
character is the product of the default character size and a scaling
factor. If no call is made to `plschr' (*note plschr; Set character
size::), the default character size is set up depending on the number
of subpages defined in the call to `plstar' (*note plstar;
Initialization::) or `plstart' (*note plstart; Initialization::), and
the scale is set to 1.0. Under normal circumstances, it is recommended
that the user does not alter the default height, but simply use the
scale parameter. This can be done by calling `plschr' (*note plschr;
Set character size::) with `def = 0.0' and `scale' set to the desired
multiple of the default height. If the default height is to be changed,
`def' is set to the new default height in millimeters, and the new
character height is again set to `def' multiplied by `scale'.

   The routine `plssym' (*note plssym; Set symbol size::) sets up the
size of all subsequent characters drawn by calls to `plpoin' (*note
plpoin; Plots a character at the specified points::) and `plsym' (*note
plsym; Plots a symbol at the specified points::). It operates
analogously to `plschr' (*note plschr; Set character size::) as
described above.

3.9 Three Dimensional Surface Plots
===================================

PLplot includes routines that will represent a single-valued function
of two variables as a surface. In this section, we shall assume that
the function to be plotted is `Z[X][Y]', where `Z' represents the
dependent variable and `X' and `Y' represent the independent variables.

   As usual, we would like to refer to a three dimensional point `(X,
Y, Z)' in terms of some meaningful user-specified coordinate system.
These are called three-dimensional world coordinates. We need to
specify the ranges of these coordinates, so that the entire surface is
contained within the cuboid defined by `xmin < x < xmax', `ymin < y <
ymax', and `zmin < z < zmax'. Typically, we shall want to view the
surface from a variety of angles, and to facilitate this, a two-stage
mapping of the enclosing cuboid is performed. Firstly, it is mapped
into another cuboid called the normalized box whose size must also be
specified by the user, and secondly this normalized box is viewed from
a particular azimuth and elevation so that it can be projected onto the
two-dimensional window.

   This two-stage transformation process allows considerable flexibility
in specifying how the surface is depicted. The lengths of the sides of
the normalized box are independent of the world coordinate ranges of
each of the variables, making it possible to use reasonable viewing
angles even if the ranges of the world coordinates on the axes are very
different. The size of the normalized box is determined essentially by
the size of the two-dimensional window into which it is to be mapped.
The normalized box is centered about the origin in the `x' and `y'
directions, but rests on the plane `z = 0'. It is viewed by an observer
located at altitude `alt' and azimuth `az', where both angles are
measured in degrees. The altitude should be restricted to the range
zero to ninety degrees for proper operation, and represents the viewing
angle above the xy plane. The azimuth is defined so that when `az = 0',
the observer sees the xz plane face on, and as the angle is increased,
the observer moves clockwise around the box as viewed from above the xy
plane. The azimuth can take on any value.

   The first step in drawing a surface plot is to decide on the size of
the two-dimensional window and the normalized box. For example, we
could choose the normalized box to have sides of length

         basex = 2.0;
         basey = 4.0;
         height = 3.0;

   A reasonable range for the x coordinate of the two-dimensional window
is -2.5 to +2.5, since the length of the diagonal across the base of
the normalized box is sqrt(2^2+4^2) = 2 sqrt(5), which fits into this
coordinate range. A reasonable range for the y coordinate of the two
dimensional window in this case is -2.5 to +4, as the the projection of
the normalized box lies in this range for the allowed range of viewing
angles.

   The routine `plwind' (*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of
viewport boundaries::) or `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window
and draw box::) is used in the usual way to establish the size of the
two-dimensional window. The routine `plw3d' (*note plw3d; Set up window
for 3-d plotting::) must then be called to establish the range of the
three dimensional world coordinates, the size of the normalized box and
the viewing angles.  After calling `plw3d' (*note plw3d; Set up window
for 3-d plotting::), the actual surface is drawn by a call to `plot3d'
(*note plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::).

   For example, if the three-dimensional world-coordinate ranges are
-10.0 <= `x' <= 10.0, -3.0 <= `y' <= +7.0, and 0.0 <= `z' <= 8.0, we
could use the following statements:

         xmin2d = -2.5;
         xmax2d =  2.5;
         ymin2d = -2.5;
         ymax2d =  4.0;
         plenv(xmin2d, xmax2d, ymin2d, ymax2d, 0, -2);
         basex = 2.0;
         basey = 4.0;
         height = 3.0;
         xmin = -10.0;
         xmax = 10.0;
         ymin = -3.0;
         ymax = 7.0;
         zmin = 0.0;
         zmax = 8.0;
         alt = 45.0;
         az = 30.0;
         side = 1;
         plw3d(basex, basey, height, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, alt, az);
         plot3d(x, y, z, nx, ny, opt, side);

   The values of the function are stored in a two-dimensional array
`z[][]' where the array element `z[i][j]' contains the value of the
function at the point x_i, y_j. (The two-dimensional array `z' is a
vectored array instead of a fixed size array. `z' points to an array of
pointers which each point to a row of the matrix.) Note that the values
of the independent variables x_i and y_j do not need to be equally
spaced, but they must lie on a rectangular grid. Thus two further
arrays `x[nx]' and `y[ny]' are required as arguments to `plot3d' (*note
plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::) to specify the values of the
independent variables. The values in the arrays x and y must be
strictly increasing with the index. The argument `opt' specifies how
the surface is outlined. If `opt = 1', a line is drawn representing z
as a function of x for each value of y, if `opt = 2', a line is drawn
representing z as a function of y for each value of x, and if `opt = 3',
a net of lines is drawn. The first two options may be preferable if one
of the independent variables is to be regarded as a parameter, whilst
the third is better for getting an overall picture of the surface. If
side is equal to one then sides are drawn on the figure so that the
graph doesn't appear to float.

   The routine `plmesh' (*note plmesh; Plot surface mesh::) is similar
to `plot3d' (*note plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::), except that it is
used for drawing mesh plots. Mesh plots allow you to see both the top
and bottom sides of a surface mesh, while 3D plots allow you to see the
top side only (like looking at a solid object). The side option is not
available with `plmesh' (*note plmesh; Plot surface mesh::).

   Labeling a three-dimensional or mesh plot is somewhat more
complicated than a two dimensional plot due to the need for skewing the
characters in the label so that they are parallel to the coordinate
axes. The routine ` plbox3' (*note plbox3; Draw a box with axes; etc;
in 3-d::) thus combines the functions of box drawing and labeling.

3.10 Contour and Shade Plots
============================

Several routines are available in PLplot which perform a contour or
shade plot of data stored in a two-dimensional array. The contourer
uses a contour following algorithm so that it is possible to use
non-continuous line styles. Further, one may specify arbitrary
coordinate mappings from array indices to world coordinates, such as
for contours in a polar coordinate system. In this case it is best to
draw the distinction between the C, Fortran 95, and Fortran 77
interfaces so these are handled in turn.

3.10.1 Contour Plots from C
---------------------------

`plcont' (*note plcont; Contour plot::) is the routine callable from C
for plotting contours.  This routine has the form:

     plcont (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, pltr,
     pltr_data);

   where `z' is the two-dimensional array of size `nx' by `ny'
containing samples of the function to be contoured. (`z' is a vectored
two-dimensional array as described in the previous section. It is not a
fixed-size two-dimensional array.) The parameters `kx', `lx', `ky' and
`ly' specify the portion of `z' that is to be considered. The array
`clevel' of length `nlevel' is a list of the desired contour levels.

   The path of each contour is initially computed in terms of the
values of the array indices which range from `0' to `nx-1' in the first
index and from `0' to `ny-1' in the second index. Before these can be
drawn in the current window (see *Note Defining the Window: Defining
the Window.), it is necessary to convert from these array indices into
world coordinates. This is done by passing a pointer `pltr' to a
user-defined transformation function to `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour
plot::). For C use of `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour plot::) (and
`plshade' (*note plshade; Shade individual region on the basis of
value::), see next subsection) we have included directly in the PLplot
library the following transformation routines: `pltr0' (*note pltr0;
Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::) (identity
transformation or you can enter a NULL argument to get the same
effect); `pltr1' (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation for grid to world
mapping using singly dimensioned coord arrays::) (linear interpolation
in singly dimensioned coordinate arrays); and `pltr2' (*note pltr2;
Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using doubly dimensioned
coord arrays [column dominant; as per normal C 2d arrays]::) (linear
interpolation in doubly dimensioned coordinate arrays). Examples of the
use of these transformation routines are given in `examples/c/x09c.c',
`examples/c/x14c.c', and `examples/c/x16c.c'. These same three examples
also demonstrate a user-defined transformation function `mypltr' which
is capable of arbitrary translation, rotation, and/or shear. By
defining other transformation subroutines, it is possible to draw
contours wrapped around polar grids etc.

3.10.5 Contour Plots from the Fortran 77 interface
--------------------------------------------------

The routines mentioned above are not recommended for use directly from
Fortran 77 due to the need to pass a function pointer. That is, the
transformation function is written in C and can not generally be
changed by the user. The call for routine `plcontfortran77' (*note
plcont; Contour plot; fixed linear mapping for Fortran 77::) from
Fortran 77 is then:

     call plcont (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel);

   When called from Fortran 77, this routine has the same effect as
when invoked from C. The interpretation of all parameters (see `plcont'
(*note plcont; Contour plot::)) is also the same except there is no
transformation function supplied as the last parameter. Instead, a
6-element array specifying coefficients to use in the transformation is
supplied via the named common block `plplot' (see code).  Since this
approach is somewhat inflexible, the user is recommended to call either
of `plcon0' (*note plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran
77::), `plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for
Fortran 77::), or `plcon2' (*note plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d
mapping for Fortran 77::) instead for Fortran 77.

   The three routines recommended for use from Fortran 77 are `plcon0'
(*note plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran 77::),
`plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran
77::), and `plcon2' (*note plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d mapping
for Fortran 77::). These routines are similar to existing commercial
plot package contour plotters in that they offer successively higher
complexity, with `plcon0' (*note plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping
for Fortran 77::) utilizing no transformation arrays, while those used
by `plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for
Fortran 77::) and `plcon2' (*note plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d
mapping for Fortran 77::) are one and two dimensional, respectively.
The call syntax for each is

     call plcon0 (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel);

     call plcon1 (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, xg1, yg1);

     call plcon2 (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, xg2, yg2);

   The `plcon0' (*note plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for
Fortran 77::) routine is implemented via a call to `plcont' (*note
plcont; Contour plot::) with a very simple (identity) transformation
function, while `plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d
mapping for Fortran 77::) and `plcon2' (*note plcon2; Contour plot;
general 2-d mapping for Fortran 77::) use interpolating transformation
functions as well as a call to `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour plot::).

   The transformation arrays are used by these routines to specify a
mapping between the computational coordinate system and the physical
one. For example, the transformation to polar coordinates might look
like:

         do i = 1, NX
             do j = 1, NY
                 xg(i, j) = r(i) * cos( theta(j) )
                 yg(i, j) = r(i) * sin( theta(j) )
             enddo
         enddo

   assuming the user had already set up arrays `r' and `theta' to
specify the (r, theta) values at the gridpoints in his system. For this
example, it is recommended that the user add an additional cell in
theta such that `xg(i, NY+1) = xg(i, 1)' and `yg(i, NY+1) = yg(i, 1)'
so that the contours show the proper periodic behavior in theta (see
also example program 9).

   The transformation function not only specifies the transformation at
grid points, but also at intermediate locations, via linear
interpolation. For example, in the `pltr1' transformation function used
by `plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for
Fortran 77::), the 1-d interpolation to get `tx' as a function of `x'
looks like (in C):

         ul = (PLINT)x;
         ur = ul + 1;
         du = x - ul;

         xl = *(xg+ul);
         xr = *(xg+ur);

         *tx = xl * (1-du)  +  xr * du;

   while in Fortran 77 this might look like:

         lxl = x
         lxr = lxl + 1
         dx = x - lxl

         xl = xg(lxl)
         xr = xg(lxr)

         tx = xl * (1-dx)  +  xr * dx

4 Deploying programs that use PLplot
************************************

This chapter provides some information on the issue of delivering
programs that use PLplot: what files should be installed and where,
what environment variables are involved and related matters.

   The scenario is this: You have created one or more programs that run
successfully on your development machine and now you need to install
them on the machine of a user.

   One solution is to provide him or her with the full development
environment that you use, but that is in general only an option if your
user is comfortable with making programs themselves. A more common
situation is that your user just wants the executable programs and
wants to get using them rightaway. We will focus on this particular
solution, as there are a few non-trivial issues.

   To be absolutely clear about what we are describing, here is a
summary:

   * Your program must run on a machine that does not have PLplot
     installed from the sources.

   * There is no development environment that you can rely on.

   * The program should be installed in a self-contained directory
     structure (which can be `/usr/local' or `c:\program' files or
     whatever, but need not be so).

   Under Linux, the easiest way to install a binary version of PLplot
on a user's machine is to use PLplot deb binary packages for the Debian
(http://www.debian.org) distribution, and PLplot rpm binary packages
for rpm-based distributions. (See the Resources area
(http://plplot.sourceforge.net/resources/index.html) of the PLplot web
site for locations of debs and rpms.)  Build the application on the
build machine using the results of the `plplot-config --cflags --libs'
command, and copy the resulting executable(s) to the users' machines.

   Under Unix (and also under Linux if you would prefer to use a newer
version of PLplot than is available in the debs or rpms), a good way to
deploy binary PLplot and applications that depend on that binary PLplot
on users' machines is as follows:

   * Use the `./configure' option `--prefix=/usr/local/plplot' (or some
     other unique but consistent directory that is available on the
     build machine and all users' machines).

   * Build and install as normal on the build machine.

   * Copy the installed PLplot tree, `/usr/local/plplot', into a
     tarball.

   * Unpack that tarball on all users' machines in the same location
     `/usr/local/plplot'.

   * Build the application(s) on the build machine using the results of
     the `plplot-config --cflags --libs' command, and copy the
     resulting executable(s) to the users' machines. Since the PLplot
     install location is consistent on all machines, the application
     should work the same way on all machines.

   On Windows, and also those rare Linux/Unix cases where you cannot
install the PLplot install tree in a consistent location on users'
machines, then there are some additional options you need to consider.

   There are three situations depending on how you configure and build
the PLplot libraries:

  1. You use the static versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
     which are not dynamically loaded.  (1)

  2. You use the shared versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
     which are not dynamically loaded.

  3. You use the shared versions of the PLplot library and devices
     which are dynamically loaded. This combination is the default
     option under Unix/Linux.

   In the first case the program will contain all the code it needs to
work, but to run successfully, it needs to find the font files,
`plstnd5.fnt' and `plxtnd5.fnt'. The mechanism used in PLplot to find
these files is fairly simple:

   * It looks at a number of built-in places, determined at the time
     the PLplot library itself was installed and built. For deployment
     these places are irrelevant in general.

   * It looks at the environment variables `PLPLOT_LIB' and
     `PLPLOT_HOME'.  (Actually, this happens only, if the corresponding
     compiler macros `PLPLOT_LIB_ENV' and `PLPLOT_HOME_ENV' were
     defined at compile time.)

   * (TODO: remark about Mac)

   Note: This is also the place to put the geographical map files, if
you happen to use them.

   The environment variables should point to the directory holding the
two font files or the one above (one variable is enough though):

   * `PLPLOT_LIB' should point to the directory actually holding these
     files

   * `PLPLOT_HOME' should point to the directory that holds a
     subdirectory `lib' which in turn holds these files.

   If it can find these, PLplot can do its job.

   Note: This is the case for instance when you use the static PLplot
library on Windows (see the directory `sys\win32\msdev\plplib').

   In the second  case the font and map files are found as in the first
case. In addition, you also require another environment variable so the
PLplot shared libraries can be found at run time by the run-time
loader. The details depend on the system you are working on, but here
are some common platforms:

   * Most UNIX, BSD and Linux systems use an environment variable
     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' which indicates directories where shared
     libraries can be found. Some use `SHLIB_PATH', like HPUX.

   * On Windows the PATH variable is used to find the DLLs, but beware:
     Windows uses a number of places to find the DLLs a program needs
     and the ordering seems to depend on some intricate details. It
     seems easiest and safest to put the DLLs in the same directory as
     your program.

   * On MacOSX, ... TODO

   In the third (default) case, the PLplot fonts and maps are found as
in the first case, and the shared libraries are found as in the second
case, but in addition the separated dynamic devices have to be found as
well.

   When PLplot uses dynamic devices, it first builds up a list of them,
by examining a directory which contains files describing those devices:
the `*.rc' files. Each of these files indicates what the relevant
properties for the device or devices. Then when the device is actually
needed, the corresponding shared object (or plug-in or DLL depending on
your terminology) is dynamically loaded.

   The directory that contains all these files (the device descriptions
as well as the actual libraries and the description files that libtool
uses) is a directory determined at the time you configured PLplot which
is typically something like
`/usr/local/plplot/lib/plplot5.3.1/driversd'. This directory must be
pointed to by the `PLPLOT_DRV_DIR' environment variable. Again for
deployment, only the environment variable is of real interest.

   To summarise the case where you don't have a deb or rpm option, and
you must use inconsistent install locations on your users' machines:

   * The following environment variables are important:

        * `PLPLOT_HOME' or `PLPLOT_LIB' to indicate the position of
          font files (and also of the various geographic maps)

        * `LD_LIBRARY_PATH', `SHLIB_PATH' or `PATH' to find the
          dynamic/shared libraries

        * `PLPLOT_DRV_DIR' to find the device descriptions

   * The following files being part of PLplot must be distributed along
     with your program:

        * The font files (`plstnd5.fnt' and `plxtnd5.fnt') and,
          possibly, if you use them, the geographic map files.

        * The PLplot shared libraries

        * The device description files and the device shared object
          files

   All the environment variables, except `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' and
equivalents, can be set within the program (by using a small
configuration file or by determining the position of the files relative
to the program's location). They just have be set before PLplot is
initialised.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) UNIX-like systems libraries can be static or shared, the first
type becoming part of the program, the second existing as a separate
file. On Windows the terms are respectively static and dynamic (the
latter type is also known as DLL).

unicode-enabled.

   The available driver options are:

   * sync: Synchronized X server operation (0|1)

   * nobuffered: Sets unbuffered operation (0|1)

   * noinitcolors: Sets cmap0 allocation (0|1)

   * defvis: Use the Default Visual (0|1)

5.2 The GCW Driver (Gnome 2)
============================

The GCW driver draws plots into a tabbed Gnome window. The driver's
features and user interface are described in *Note GCW Driver Basics:
GCW Driver Basics.. A specialized API allows interaction with the
driver, and this is described in *Note GCW Driver API: GCW Driver API..

* Menu:

* GCW Driver Basics::

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: GCW Driver Basics,  Next: GCW Driver API,  Up: The GCW Driver [Gnome 2]

5.2.1 GCW Driver Basics
-----------------------

The GCW driver plots each page into an individual tab within a Gnome
window. The user interface built into the window allows a variety of
actions. In particular, pages can be saved to files with extensions
.ps, .psc, .png, .jpg, and .gif, which correspond to PLplot output
driver devices described in *Note The PLplot Output Driver Family: The
PLplot Output Driver Family..

   The GCW driver supports anti-aliasing and is unicode enabled.

   There are a variety of hot keys that may be used in the user
interface:

   * Arrows : Change page

   * + : Zooms in

   * - : Zooms out

   * = : Zooms to 100%

   * q : Quits

   The available driver options (used with the `-drvopt' command-line
argument) are:

   * text: Use TrueType fonts (0|1); default 1

   * pixmap: Use pixmap for plotting lines and shades (0|1); default 1

   * hrshsym: Use Hershey symbol set (0|1); default 0

   The `text' option toggles between TrueType and Hershey fonts. The
Hershey fonts provide a reference implementation for text
representation in PLplot.

   The `hrshsym' option is used to indicate that symbols should be
drawn using the Hershey fonts. This is useful when plots need to be
saved to PostScript files, because the Type I fonts used by the PS and
PSC devices do not support all Unicode symbols.

   Most of the command-line arguments described in *Note Command Line
Arguments: Command Line Arguments. are also supported. Some key
arguments for use with the GCW driver are:

   * geometry geom: Sets page size, in pixels (e.g. -geometry 400x300)

   * nopixmap: Disables pixmap usage for plotting lines and shades

   * portrait: Sets portrait mode (both orientation and aspect ratio)

   The `nopixmap' option disables the use of the internal pixmap for
drawing lines and shades, which will normally appear somewhat
pixelated. The `nopixmap' option directs the driver to use anti-aliased
vector graphics instead, resulting in higher quality plots but rendered
at a slower speed. This option does not affect the quality of plots

5.2.2 GCW Driver API
--------------------

The GCW driver provides an additional API that allows for a higher
degree of control by the user. The C API is described below, and
bindings to other languages are described in *** NEEDS DOCUMENTATION
***.

   The function prototypes are defined in `gcw.h'.  Programs that need
access to this API must be linked against the libplplotgnome2d library
rather than libplplotd. This is most easily accomplished using
pkg-config; i.e.,


             gcc x01c.c -o x01c `pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd-gnome2`

You may need to remind pkg-config where to look for the plplotd-gnome2
file installed by PLplot; e.g.,


             gcc x01c.c -o x01c `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd-gnome2`

5.5.1 wxWidgets Driver Basics
-----------------------------

The wxWidgets driver plots in a Frame provided by the wxWidgets
library. The driver is quite complete but lacks many of the GUI
features of the TK or GCW drivers. All plots are available at once an
one can switch between all plots by pressing Alt-n. The application can
be quit with Alt-x. These functions are also available in the menu.
After the last plot one will advance again to the first plot.
Anti-aliasing is supported and and the wxWidgets driver is unicode
enabled. It is also possible to address the wxWidgets driver from
within a wxWidgets application - this is described in the next section.

   The available driver options (used with the `-drvopt' command-line
argument) are:

   * text: Use TrueType fonts (0|1); default 1

   * smooth: switch on/off anti-aliasing (0|1); default 1

   The text option toggles between TrueType and Hershey fonts. The
Hershey fonts provide a reference implementation for text
representation in PLplot.

   The smooth option will turn on or off text smoothing for True Type
fonts. This will increase the time for a plot considerably.

6.2 The PDF Driver
==================

A basic version of a pdf driver has been added to PLplot. This driver
is based on the libharu library see: http://libharu.sourceforge.net/
(http://libharu.sourceforge.net/).  At present only the hershey fonts
are used and there is no support for pdf or ttf fonts. Compression of
the pdf output is not enabled and the paper size can't be chosen. All
these issues will be addressed in later releases.

6.3 The PostScript Driver
=========================

The PostScript driver produces publication-quality PostScript output.
The driver provides two devices: the ps device for black-and-white
plots, and the psc device for color plots.

   This driver is unicode enabled, and PostScript Type I fonts are used.
Type I fonts do not have all of the available unicode symbols
represented. For this reason, Hershey fonts are used for drawing
symbols by default, unless specified otherwise using the driver options.

   The available driver options are:

   * text: Use PostScript text (0|1); default 1

   * color: Use color (0|1); default 1

   * hrshsym: Use Hershey fonts for symbols (0|1); default 1


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: The TrueType PostScript Driver,  Next: The LaTeX PostScript Driver,  Prev: The PostScript Driver,  Up: The PLplot Output Driver Family

6.4 The TrueType PostScript Driver
==================================

This is a PostScript driver that supports TrueType fonts. This allows
access to a far greater range of fonts and characters than is possible
using Type 1 PostScript fonts (see *Note The PostScript Driver: The
PostScript Driver.).  It is the driver to use for generating
publication quality output using PLplot. The driver provides two
devices: the ps-ttf device for black-and-white plots and the ps-ttfc
device for color plots.

   The driver requires the LASi (v1.0.5), pango and pangoft2 libraries
to work. The pango and pangoft2 libraries are widely distributed with
most Linux distributions and give the psttf driver full complex text
layout (CTL) capability (see
http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php
(http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php) for an example of
this capability). The LASi library is not part of most distributions at
this time. The source code can be downloaded from
http://www.unifont.org/lasi/. The library is small and easy to build
and install. Make sure you use LASi-1.0.5. The psttf device driver uses
new capabilities in this version of LASi and no longer works with
LASi-1.0.4.

   The available driver options are:

   * text: Use TrueType fonts for text (0|1); default 1

   * color: Use color (0|1); default 1

   * hrshsym: Use Hershey fonts for symbols (0|1); default 0


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: The LaTeX PostScript Driver,  Next: The SVG Driver,  Prev: The TrueType PostScript Driver,  Up: The PLplot Output Driver Family

6.5 The LaTeX PostScript Driver
===============================

This is a PostScript device driver that writes out its results in two
files. (1) The encapsulated postscript (EPS) file contains all the
postscript commands for rendering the plot without characters, and (2)
the LaTeX file contains a fragment of LaTeX that reads in the EPS file
and renders the plot characters using LaTeX commands (and LaTeX fonts!)
in alignment with the EPS file to produce a combined result.

   Suppose you create the EPS and LaTeX files with the following
command: `./x01c -dev pstex -o x01c.eps'. The EPS file is then stored
in `x01c.eps' and the LaTeX fragment is stored in `x01c.eps_t'. Then
you may use the generated files with the `x01c.tex' LaTeX code that
follows:

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
     \begin{document}
     \input{x01c.eps_t}
     \end{document}

   and generate PostScript results using the LaTeX fonts with the
following command: `latex x01c.tex; dvips -f <x01c.dvi >x01c.ps '. The
results look good (aside from an obvious bounding-box problem that
still needs to be fixed with this device) and should be useful for
LaTeX enthusiasts.

   There are no available driver options.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: The SVG Driver,  Prev: The LaTeX PostScript Driver,  Up: The PLplot Output Driver Family

6.6 The SVG Driver
==================

The SVG driver produces Scalable Vector Graphics files that are
compliant with the SVG 1.1 specification as defined here:
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/. The driver is unicode enabled and both
text and lines are anti-aliased. As SVG is just an XML based graphics
language, the visual quality of the resulting plot will depend on the
SVG rendering engine that is used and what fonts that are available to
it.

7 C Language
************

(OLD, NEEDS DOCUMENTATION UPDATING) The argument types given in this
manual (PLFLT and PLINT) are typedefs for the actual argument type. A
PLINT is actually a type `long' and should not be changed. A PLFLT can
be either a `float' or `double'; this choice is made when the package
is installed and on a Unix system (for example) may result in a PLplot
library named `libplplot.a' in single precision and `libplplotd.a' in
double precision.

   These and other constants used by PLplot are defined in the main
header file `plplot.h', which must be included by the user program.
This file also contains all of the function prototypes, machine
dependent defines, and redefinition of the C-language bindings that
conflict with the Fortran names (more on this later). `plplot.h'
obtains its values for PLFLT, PLINT, and PLARGS (a macro for
conditionally generating prototype argument lists) from FLOAT
(typedef), INT (typedef), and PROTO (macro), respectively.  The latter
are defined in the file `chdr.h'. The user is encouraged to use FLOAT,
INT, and PROTO in his/her own code, and modify `chdr.h' according to
taste. It is not actually necessary to declare variables as FLOAT and
INT except when they are pointers, as automatic conversion to the right
type will otherwise occur (if using a Standard C compiler; else K&R
style automatic promotion will occur). The only code in `plplot.h' that
directly depends on these settings is as follows:


     #include "plplot/chdr.h"

     /* change from chdr.h conventions to plplot ones */

     typedef FLOAT PLFLT;
     typedef INT   PLINT;
     #define PLARGS(a) PROTO(a)

   PLplot is capable of being compiled with Standard C (ANSI) mode on
or off.  This is toggled via the macro PLSTDC, and set automatically if
__STDC__ is defined. If PLSTDC is defined, all functions are prototyped
as allowed under Standard C, and arguments passed exactly as specified
in the prototype. If PLSTDC is not defined, however, function
prototypes are turned off and K&R automatic argument promotion will
occur, e.g.  ` float &rarr; double, int &rarr; long'.  There is no
middle ground! A PLplot library built with PLSTDC defined will not work
(in general) with a program built with PLSTDC undefined, and vice
versa. It is possible in principle to build a library that will work
under both Standard C and K&R compilers simultaneously (i.e. by
duplicating the K&R promotion with the Standard C prototype), but this
seems to violate the spirit of the C standard and can be confusing.
Eventually we will drop support for non-standard C compilers but for
now have adopted this compromise.

   In summary, PLplot will work using either a Standard or non-standard
C compiler, provided that you :

   * Include the PLplot main header file `plplot.h'.

   * Make sure all pointer arguments are of the correct type (the
     compiler should warn you if you forget, so don't worry, be happy).

   * Do not link a code compiled with PLSTDC defined to a PLplot library
     compiled with PLSTDC undefined, or vice versa.

   * Use prototypes whenever possible to reduce type errors.

   Note that some Standard C compilers will give warnings when
converting a constant function argument to whatever is required by the
prototype. These warnings can be ignored.

   The one additional complicating factor concerns the use of stub
routines to interface with Fortran (see the following section for more
explanation). On some systems, the Fortran and C namespaces are set up
to clobber each other.  More reasonable (from our viewpoint) is to
agree on a standard map between namespaces, such as the appending of an
underscore to Fortran routine names as is common on many Unix-like
systems. The only case where the shared Fortran/C namespaces do any
good is when passing a pointer to a like data type, which represents
only a small fraction of the cases that need to be handled (which
includes constant values passed on the stack, strings, and
two-dimensional arrays).

   There are several ways to deal with this situation, but the least
messy from a user's perspective is to redefine those PLplot C function
names which conflict with the Fortran-interface stub routines. The
actual function names are the same as those described in this document,
but with a c_ prepended. These macro definitions appear in the
`plplot.h' header file and are otherwise harmless. Therefore you can
(and should) forget that most of the names are being redefined to avoid
the conflict and simply adhere to the bindings as described in this
manual. Codes written under old versions of PLplot (previous to 5.0)
will require a recompile, however.

   For more information on calling PLplot from C, please see the
example C programs (`x01c.c' through `x19c.c') distributed with PLplot.

8 Fortran 95 Language
*********************

As discussed in the preceding section, PLplot's integer representation
is a PLINT and its floating point representation is a PLFLT. To the
Fortran 95 user, this most commonly translates to a type `integer' and
type `real', respectively. This is somewhat system dependent (and up to
the installer of the package) so you should check the release notes to
be sure, or just try it and see what happens.

   Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used
in the description of each PLplot function. Thus to understand this
manual it is helpful to know a little about C, but fortunately the
translation is very easy and can be summarized here. As an example, the
routine `plline' (*note plline; Draw a line::) call from C would look
like:


     	plline(n,x,y);

The argument `n' is the number of points that make up the line and the
arguments `x' and `y' are arrays of floating-point numbers containing
the x- and y-coordinates of the points.

   In C you need to specify the array dimensions explicitly, whereas in
Fortran 95 the array dimension can be implicit, which leads to less
mistakes. The interface to `plline' would ideally look like this:


     	interface
     		subroutine plline(x,y)
     		real, dimension(:) :: x, y
     		end subroutine plline
     	end interface

This is the way of calling PLplot routines in Fortran 95 - it is less
error-prone than the Fortran 77 way (see the chapter on Fortran 77).
(1)

   There is one slight complication: PLplot can be compiled with either
single-precision reals or double-precision reals. It is very important
to keep the variables that are passed to PLplot in the same precision.
Fortunately, Fortran 95 provides the `KIND' mechanism for this.

   The actual interface to `plline' therefore looks like:


     	interface
     		subroutine plline(x,y)
     		real(kind=plflt), dimension(:) :: x, y
     		end subroutine plline
     	end interface

The parameter `plflt' is defined in the `PLplot' module and should be
used consistently with all real variables that you pass to PLplot
routines.

   Here is a short overview of how C data types correspond to Fortran 95
data types:

PLFLT                                real(kind=plflt)
PLINT                                integer
char *                               character
PLFLT *                              real(kind=plflt) or
                                     real(kind=plflt), dimension(:)
PLFLT **                             real(kind=plflt), dimension(:,:)
`"string"'                           `'string''
array[0]                             array(1)

In C there are two ways to pass a variable -- by value (the default) or
by reference (pointer), whereas only the latter is used by Fortran 95.
Therefore when you see references in the text to either an ordinary
argument or a pointer argument (e.g. `*data'), you simply use an
ordinary Fortran 95 variable or array name (the interfacing routines
take care of any transformations that may be necessary).

   The PLplot library comes with a set of Fortran 95 interface routines
that allow the same call semantics (usually) regardless of whether
calling from C or Fortran 95. In some cases, the Fortran 95 interface
uses implicit array dimensions, so that it has fewer arguments than the
C counterpart.

   These stub routines handle transforming the data from the normal
Fortran 95 representation to that typically used in C. This includes:

   * Variables passed by value instead of by reference.

     Fortran 95 passes all subroutine arguments by reference, i.e., a
     pointer to the argument value is pushed on the stack. In C all
     values, except for arrays (including char arrays), are passed by
     value, i.e., the argument value itself is pushed on the stack. The
     stub routine converts the Fortran 95 call by reference to a call
     by value. As an example, here is how the plpoin stub routine
     works. In your Fortran 95 program you might have a call to plpoin
     that looks something like


                real(kind=pllft), dimension(6) :: x, y
                x = ...
                y = ...
                call plpoin(x,y,9)

     where x and y are arrays with 6 elements and you want to plot
     symbol 9.  The routine `plpoin' calls the underlying routine
     `plpoinf77':


                subroutine plpoin( x, y, code )
                   integer                        :: code
                   real(kind=plflt), dimension(:) :: x, y

                   call plpoinf77( size(x), x, y, code )
                end subroutine plpoin

     This takes care of the size of the arrays - it is not possible to
     transfer this information to C in an implicit way.

     The routine plpoinf77 is implemented in C to take care of the
     question pass by value or pass by reference: (2)


          #include "plplot/plstubs.h"

          void
          PLPOIN(n, x, y, code)
          PLINT *n, *code;
          PLFLT *x, *y;
          {
              c_plpoin(*n, x, y, *code);
          }

     All this stub routine does is convert the number of points (`*n'
     and the symbol `*code' to call by value (i.e. pushes their value
     on the stack) and then calls the C plpoin library routine.

   * Get mapping between Fortran 95 and C namespace right (system
     dependent).

     The external symbols (i.e. function and subroutine names) as you
     see them in your program often appear differently to the linker.
     For example, the Fortran 95 routine names may be converted to
     uppercase or lowercase, and/or have an underscore appended or
     prepended. This translation is handled entirely via redefinition
     of the stub routine names, which are macros.  During the build
     process, the properties of the build environment are detected and
     the correct compiler options are used.

     Once the name translation is established during installation, name
     translation is completely transparent to the user.

   * Translation of character string format from Fortran 95 to C.

     Fortran 95 character strings are passed differently than other
     quantities, in that a string descriptor is pushed on the stack
     along with the string address. C doesn't want the descriptor, it
     wants a NULL terminated string.  For routines that handle strings
     two stub routines are necessary, one written in Fortran 95 and one
     written in C. Your Fortran 95 program calls the Fortran 95 stub
     routine first. This stub converts the character string to a null
     terminated integer array and then calls the C stub routine. The C
     stub routine converts the integer array (type `long') to the usual
     C string representation (which may be different, depending on
     whether your machine uses a big endian or little endian byte
     ordering; in any case the way it is done in PLplot is portable).
     See the `plmtex' stubs for an example of this.

     Note that the portion of a Fortran 95 character string that
     exceeds 299 characters will not be plotted by the text routines
     (`plmtex' and `plptex').

   * Multidimensional array arguments are changed from row-dominant to
     column-dominant ordering through use of a temporary array.

     In Fortran 95, arrays are always stored so that the first index
     increases most rapidly as one steps through memory. This is called
     row-dominant storage. In C, on the other hand, the first index
     increases least rapidly, i.e. column-dominant ordering. Thus, two
     dimensional arrays (e.g. as passed to the contour or surface
     plotting routines) passed into PLplot must be transposed in order
     to get the proper two-dimensional relationship to the world
     coordinates. This is handled in the C stub routines by dynamic
     memory allocation of a temporary array. This is then set equal to
     the transpose of the passed in array and passed to the appropriate
     PLplot routine. The overhead associated with this is normally not
     important but could be a factor if you are using very large 2d
     arrays.

   This all seems a little messy, but is very user friendly. Fortran 95
and C programmers can use the same basic interface to the library,
which is a powerful plus for this method. The fact that stub routines
are being used is completely transparent to the Fortran 95 programmer.

   For more information on calling PLplot from Fortran 95, please see
the example Fortran 95 programs (`/examples/f95/x??f.f') distributed
with PLplot.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The Fortran 77 way is still available: you can call the routine
`pllinef77' that has the same argument list as the Fortran 77 routine
`plline'. This is not documented, however, other than by this note.

   (2) `PLPOIN' is a macro that get translated into the correct name
for this routine - various Fortran compilers use different conventions,
such as adding an underscore or translating the name into capitals.

array[0]                             array(1)

In C there are two ways to pass a variable -- by value (the default) or
by reference (pointer), whereas only the latter is used by Fortran 77.
Therefore when you see references in the text to either an ordinary
argument or a pointer argument (e.g. `*data'), you simply use an
ordinary Fortran 77 variable or array name.

   The PLplot library comes with a set of Fortran 77 interface routines
that allow the exact same call syntax (usually) regardless of whether
calling from C or Fortran 77. In some cases, this means the subroutine
name  exceeds 8 characters in length. Nearly every Fortran 77 compiler
available today allows subroutine names longer than 8 characters, so
this should not be a problem (although if it ever is, in principle a
truncated name could be defined for that platform).

   These stub routines handle transforming the data from the normal
Fortran 77 representation to that typically used in C. This includes:

   * Variables passed by value instead of by reference.

     Fortran 77 passes all subroutine arguments by reference, i.e., a
     pointer to the argument value is pushed on the stack. In C all
     values, except for arrays (including char arrays), are passed by
     value, i.e., the argument value itself is pushed on the stack. The
     stub routine converts the Fortran 77 call by reference to a call
     by value. As an example, here is how the plpoin stub routine
     works. In your Fortran 77 program you might have a call to plpoin
     that looks something like


                call plpoin(6,x,y,9)

     where x and y are arrays with 6 elements and you want to plot
     symbol 9.  As strange as it seems (at least to C programmers) the
     constants 6 and 9 are passed by reference. This will actually call
     the following C stub routine (included in entirety)


          #include "plplot/plstubs.h"

          void
          PLPOIN(n, x, y, code)
          PLINT *n, *code;
          PLFLT *x, *y;
          {
              c_plpoin(*n, x, y, *code);
          }

     All this stub routine does is convert the number of points (`*n'
     and the symbol `*code' to call by value (i.e. pushes their value
     on the stack) and then calls the C plpoin library routine.

   * Get mapping between Fortran 77 and C namespace right (system
     dependent).

     The external symbols (i.e. function and subroutine names) as you
     see them in your program often appear differently to the linker.
     For example, the Fortran 77 routine names may be converted to
     uppercase or lowercase, and/or have an underscore appended or
     prepended. This translation is handled entirely via redefinition
     of the stub routine names, which are macros.  There are several
     options for compiling PLplot that simplify getting the name
     translation right (NEEDS DOCUMENTATION IF THESE STILL EXIST). In
     any case, once the name translation is established during
     installation, name translation is completely transparent to the
     user.

   * Translation of character string format from Fortran 77 to C.

     Fortran 77 character strings are passed differently than other
     quantities, in that a string descriptor is pushed on the stack
     along with the string address. C doesn't want the descriptor, it
     wants a NULL terminated string.  For routines that handle strings
     two stub routines are necessary, one written in Fortran 77 and one
     written in C. Your Fortran 77 program calls the Fortran 77 stub
     routine first. This stub converts the character string to a null
     terminated integer array and then calls the C stub routine. The C
     stub routine converts the integer array (type `long') to the usual
     C string representation (which may be different, depending on
     whether your machine uses a big endian or little endian byte
     ordering; in any case the way it is done in PLplot is portable).
     See the `plmtex' stubs for an example of this.

     Note that the portion of a Fortran 77 character string that
     exceeds 299 characters will not be plotted by the text routines
     (`plmtex' and `plptex').

   * Multidimensional array arguments are changed from row-dominant to
     column-dominant ordering through use of a temporary array.

     In Fortran 77, arrays are always stored so that the first index
     increases most rapidly as one steps through memory. This is called
     row-dominant storage. In C, on the other hand, the first index
     increases least rapidly, i.e. column-dominant ordering. Thus, two
     dimensional arrays (e.g. as passed to the contour or surface
     plotting routines) passed into PLplot must be transposed in order
     to get the proper two-dimensional relationship to the world
     coordinates. This is handled in the C stub routines by dynamic
     memory allocation of a temporary array. This is then set equal to
     the transpose of the passed in array and passed to the appropriate
     PLplot routine. The overhead associated with this is normally not
     important but could be a factor if you are using very large 2d
     arrays.

   This all seems a little messy, but is very user friendly. Fortran 77
and C programmers can use the same basic interface to the library,
which is a powerful plus for this method. The fact that stub routines
are being used is completely transparent to the Fortran 77 programmer.

10 A C++ Interface for PLplot
*****************************

PLplot has long had C and Fortran bindings, presenting a fairly
conventional API to the applications programmer. Recently (1994
onwards) PLplot has been growing interfaces (language bindings) to a
variety of other languages. In this chapter we discuss the PLplot C++
support provided in the PLplot distribution. Of course many other
approaches are possible, perhaps even in use by PLplot users around the
world. The purpose of this chapter then is to explain the rationale and
intended usage for the bundled C++ language support.

10.1 Motivation for the C++ Interface
=====================================

PLplot has a fairly complex C API. There are lots of functions, and
several facilities have multiple entry points with similar names but
different argument lists. (Think contouring, shading). Often these
differing argument lists are to accommodate a variety of data storage
paradigms, one of which you are expected to be using!

   Especially in the case of the 2-d API's for contouring and shading,
sophisticated C++ users may feel a special sense of exasperation with
the data layout prescriptions, since they are extremely primitive,
pointer rich, and prone to a wide class of memory leaks and other sorts
of programming errors. Many C++ users know good and well that better
ways exist (templated matrix classes, etc), but historically have not
been able to use these more sophisticated techniques if the contained
data ever needed to get plotted.

   Besides the 2-d API functions, there is also the multiple output
stream capability of PLplot. Anyone who knows C++ well, and who has
used multiple output streams in PLplot, has probably noticed striking
similarities between the PLplot `PLStream' pointer and the C++ `this'
pointer. Although multiple output streams have not been widely used in
PLplot applications in the past, the availability of the plframe Tk
widget, and the extended wish concept, is making it much more
attractive to use multiple output streams.

   Unfortunately, if you do write a Tk extended wish application, and
endow your interface with multiple plframes, the event driven character
of X applications makes it difficult to ensure that PLplot output shows
up in the right plframe window. If a plot is generated to one plframe,
the PLplot `PLStream' pointer is directed to that stream. If a user
then pushes a Tk button which should generate a plot to a different
plframe, the plot goes to the old plframe instead!  Schemes for
controlling this can be imagined, but the logic can be complex,
especially in the face of the ability to /also/ make plots to the same
plframe from either Tcl or C++.

   Beyond this, the C API is downright "ugly" for a significant number
of the functions, particularly those which return values by accepting
pointers to variables in their argument lists, and then changing them
in that way. Sophisticated C++ users generally take considerable pride
in banishing the offensive bare pointer from their code, and consider
it disgusting to have to insert &'s just in order to make a call to an
API function.

   In order to address these issues (and more), I have begun
constructing a C++ interface to PLplot. The purpose of this missive is
to describe its architecture and usage.

10.2 Design of the PLplot C++ Interface
=======================================

* Collapsing the API::


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Stream/Object Identity,  Next: Namespace Management,  Up: Design of the PLplot C++ Interface

10.2.1 Stream/Object Identity
-----------------------------

A C++ class named `plstream' has been introduced. It's central purpose
is provide a specific, object based encapsulation of the concept of a
PLplot output stream. Any output produced using a `plstream' object,
will go to the PLplot output stream associated with that object,
regardless of what stream may have been active before.

   In order to write a multiple output stream PLplot application, a C++
program can declare `plstream' objects, and invoke drawing methods on
those objects, without regard to ordering considerations or other
coherency considerations. Although this has obvious simplification
benefit even for simple programs, the full benefit is most easily
appreciated in the context of Tk extended wish applications in which a
`plstream' can be associated with each plframe.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Namespace Management,  Next: Abstraction of Data Layout,  Prev: Stream/Object Identity,  Up: Design of the PLplot C++ Interface

10.2.2 Namespace Management
---------------------------

The PLplot C API is composed of a set of drawing functions, all
prefixed with "pl", in an effort to prevent namespace collision.
However, the prefix "pl" is gratuitous, and in particular is
unnecessary in a C++ context. The `plstream' class mirrors most of the
PLplot C API, but does so by dropping the "pl" prefix. The `plstream'
class thus serves to collect the PLplot drawing functions into a scope
in which collisions with other similarly named functions is not a
concern. So, where a C programmer might write:


             plsstrm( 1 );
     	plenv( ... );
     	plline( ... );

   The C++ programmer can write:


     	plstream p( ... );
     	p.env( ... );
     	p.line( ... );

   Is that an important benefit? The utility varies with the number of
output streams in use in the program.

   plmkstrm() is replaced by object declaration. plsstrm() is replaced
by method invocation on the desired output stream object. plgstrm() is
rendered irrelevant.

   The skeptic may say, "But you have to type the same number of
characters! You've replaced 'pl' with 'p.', except it could be worse
for a longer object name." True. BUT, in this new scheme, most plots
will not be generated by invoking methods on a specific stream object,
but rather by deriving from `plstream', and invoking methods of "this"
object. See the section on derivation below.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Abstraction of Data Layout,  Next: Collapsing the API,  Prev: Namespace Management,  Up: Design of the PLplot C++ Interface

10.2.3 Abstraction of Data Layout
---------------------------------

The `plstream' class will provide an abstract interface to the 2-d
drawing functions. Instead of forcing the C++ user to organize data in
one of a small set of generally braindead data layouts with poor memory
management properties, potentially forcing the C++ user to not use a
superior method, or to copy data computed in one layout format to
another for plotting (with consequent bug production), the `plstream'
2-d plotting functions will accept an abstract layout specification.
The only thing which is important to the 2-d drawing functions is that
the data be "indexable". They should not care about data layout.

   Consequently, an abstract class, "Contourable_Data" is provided. This
class provides a pure virtual method which accepts indexes, and is to
be made to produce a function value for the user's 2-d data field. It
is of no concern to PLplot how the user does this. Any mapping between
index and data which the user wishes to use, may be used.

   This methodology allows the C++ user to compute data using whatever
storage mechanism he wants. Then, by deriving a class from PLplot's
Contourable_Data abstract class, he can provide a mapping to his own
data layout.

   Note that this does /not/ mean that the C++ user's internal data
layout must be derived from PLplot's Contourable_Data class. Suppose
for example that the user data is stored in a C++ "matrix" class.  To
make this data contourable, the user may define a class which
specializes the indexing concept of the PLplot Contourable_Data class
to his matrix class. For example:


     class Matrix { ... };
     class Contourable_Matrix : public Contourable_Data {
         Matrix& m;
       public:
         Contourable_Matrix( Matrix& _m ) : m(_m) {}
         PLFLT  operator()( int i, int j ) const { return m(i,j); }
     };

     plstream p( ... );
     Matrix m;
     // Code to fill m with data
     Contourable_Matrix cm(m);
     p.shade( cm, ... );

   In this way the C++ user is completely freed from the tyranny of
moronic data layout constraints imposed by PLplot's C or Fortran API.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Collapsing the API,  Prev: Abstraction of Data Layout,  Up: Design of the PLplot C++ Interface

10.2.4 Collapsing the API
-------------------------

Use of abstraction as in C) above will allow a single method in
`plstream' to perform the services of multiple functions in the C API.
In those cases where multiple functions were provided with different
data layout specifications, but similar functionality, these can all be
collapsed into one, through the use of the abstract interface technique
described above.  Moreover, function name overloading can be used to
simplify the namespace for those cases where multiple functions were
used to get variations on a basic capability. For example, a single
name such as contour or shade can be used for multiple methods taking
different argument sets, so that for example, one can make simple plots
of rectangular data sets, or more complex generalized coordinate
mappings.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface,  Next: Status of the C++ Interface,  Prev: Design of the PLplot C++ Interface,  Up: A C++ Interface for PLplot

10.3 Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface
==========================================

The `plstream' class is an ideal candidate for derivation. By
inheriting from `plstream', the user can construct a new class which is
automatically endowed with the ability to plot to a specific PLplot
output stream in a coherent manner without having to worry about
interplay with other `plstream' (or derived type) objects.  Moreover,
new, higher level, plotting functionality can be constructed to provide
even more simplicity and ease of use than the PLplot API.

   The PLplot maintainers (Geoff and Maurice) expect to introduce a
class plxstream in the future which provides superior support for
constructing graphics with multiple plots per page, easier
specification of plot adornments, etc. This should significantly ease
one aspect of PLplot usage which we regard as being clumsy at this time.

   Beyond that, users may find it useful to derive from `plstream' (or
later plxstream whenever it finally makes its appearance) for the
purpose of making "application specific" output streams. For example, a
C++ program will normally have a variety of objects which constitute
the fundamental entities in the code. These could all be made to be
"atomically plotted" by providing suitable methods. For example:


     class Cat { ... };
     class Dog { ... };
     class Bear { ... };
     class Fish { ... };

     class zoostream : public plstream {
       public:
         void plot( const Cat& c ) { ... }
         void plot( const Dog& d ) { ... }
         void plot( const Bear& b ) { ... }
         void plot( const Fish& f ) { ... }
     };

   Presumably the PLplot user community can think of even more
imaginative uses... :-).


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Status of the C++ Interface,  Prev: Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface,  Up: A C++ Interface for PLplot

10.4 Status of the C++ Interface
================================

The class `plstream' (and the other abstraction classes in
`plstream.h') provided in PLplot 4.99j (alpha) are to be considered as
works in progress. By the standards outlined above, the work has barely
begun. At this time, `plstream' is mostly a one to one mirror of the C
API, which is to say, it is still far from the goals of simplification
and abstraction outlined above. As such, it can be expected to change
radically over the course of time. (We don't quote schedules-how long
have you been waiting for 5.0? :-).

   In any event, we would welcome improvement submissions along the
lines of those above, but we would strongly discourage people from using
`plstream' if they are expecting it to be rock solid. It will be
changing, to become more like the design goals elucidated above.

   So, if you like the ideas described above, and are willing to accept
the burden of "upgrading" your code as the class `plstream' evolves,
then feel free to use it. Just don't whine when I fix some of the
methods to take references instead of pointers, when I eliminate some
of the redundant methods to use the collapsed form, etc.

11 Using PLplot from Tcl
************************

PLplot has historically had C and Fortran language bindings. PLplot
version 5.0 introduces a plethora of new programming options including
C++ (described earlier) and several script language bindings. The Tcl
interface to PLplot (which the PLplot maintainers regard as the primary
script language binding) is described in this chapter, with further
discussion of Tcl related issues following in additional chapters. But
Tcl is certainly not the only script language option.  Bindings to
Perl, Python, and Scheme (which is actually another compiled language,
but still has some of the flavor of a VHLL) are in various stages of
completion, and are described in separate chapters.  Use the one that
suits you best-or try them all!

11.1 Motivation for the Tcl Interface to PLplot
===============================================

The recent emergence of several high quality VHLL script languages such
as Tcl, Perl, Python and arguably even some Lisp variants, is having a
profound effect upon the art of computer programming. Tasks which have
traditionally been handled by C or Fortran, are beginning to be seen in
a new light. With relatively fast processors now widely available, many
programming jobs are no longer bound by execution time, but by human
time. Rapidity of initial development and continued maintenance, for a
surprisingly wide class of applications, is far more important than
execution time. Result: in a very short period of time, say from 1993
to 1995, script languages have exploded onto the scene, becoming
essential tools for any serious programmer.

   Moreover, the entire concept of speed of execution needs revising in
the face of the gains made in computer hardware in recent years.
Saying that script language processing is slower than compiled language
processing may be undeniable and simultaneously irrelevant.  If the
script language processing is fast enough, then it is fast enough.
Increasingly, computational researchers are finding that script based
tools are indeed fast enough. And if their run time is fast enough, and
their development and maintenance time is much much better, then why
indeed should they not be used?

   Even in a field with several high visibility players, Tcl has
distinguished itself as a leading contender. There are many reasons for
this, but perhaps the most important, at least as it relates to the
PLplot user community, is that Tcl was designed to be extensible and
embeddable. The whole purpose of Tcl, as it name (Tool Command
Language) indicates, is to be a command language for other tools. In
other words, the fact that Tcl is capable of being a standalone shell
is interesting, even useful, but nonetheless incidental. The real
attraction of Tcl is that it can be the shell language for your code.
Tcl can easily be embedded into your code, endowing it immediately with
a full featured, consistent and well documented script programming
language, providing all the core features you need in a programming
language: variables, procedures, control structures, error trapping and
recovery, tracing, etc. But that is only the beginning! After that, you
can easily extend Tcl by adding commands to the core language, which
invoke the capabilities of your tool. It is in this sense that Tcl is a
tool command language. It is a command language which you can augment
to provide access to the facilities of your tool.

   But Tcl is more than just an embeddable, extensible script language
for personal use. Tcl is an industry, an internet phenomenon. There are
currently at least two high quality books, with more on the way.  There
is an industry of service providers and educators. Furthermore,
literally hundreds of Tcl extensions exist, and are readily available
over the net. Perhaps the most notable extension, Tk, provides a
fantastic interface to X Windows widget programming, permitting the
construction of Motif like user interfaces, with none of the hassles of
actually using Motif. Some of these extensions endow Tcl with object
oriented facilities philosophically similar to C++ or other object
oriented languages. Other extensions provide script level access to
system services. Others provide a script interface to sockets, RPC, and
other network programming protocols. The list goes on and on. Dive into
the Tcl archive, and see what it has for you!

   So, the answer to the question Why do we want a Tcl interface to
PLplot? is very simple. Because we we are using Tcl anyway, as the
command language for our project, and would like to be able to do
plotting in the command language just as we do so many other things.

   But there is more than just the aesthetics of integration to
consider.  There are also significant pragmatic considerations. If you
generate your PLplot output via function calls from a compiled
language, then in order to add new diagnostics to your code, or to
refine or embellish existing ones, you have to edit the source,
recompile, relink, and rerun the code. If many iterations are required
to get the plot right, significant time can be wasted. This can be
especially true in the case of C++ code making heavy use of templates,
for which many C++ compilers will have program link times measured in
minutes rather than seconds, even for trivial program changes.

   In contrast, if the diagnostic plot is generated from Tcl, the
development cycle looks more like: start the shell (command line or
windowing), source a Tcl script, issue the command to generate the
plot, notice a bug, edit the Tcl script, resource the script, and
regenerate the plot. Notice that compiling, linking, and restarting the
program, have all been dropped from the development cycle. The time
savings from such a development cycle can be amazing!

11.2 Overview of the Tcl Language Binding
=========================================

Each of the PLplot calls available to the C or Fortran programmer are
also available from Tcl, with the same name and generally the same
arguments. Thus for instance, whereas in C you can write:


     plenv( 0., 1., 0., 1., 0, 0 );
     pllab( "(x)", "(y)", "The title of the graph" );

   you can now write in Tcl:


     plenv 0 1 0 1 0 0
     pllab "(x)" "(y)" "The title of the graph"

   All the normal Tcl rules apply, there is nothing special about the
PLplot extension commands. So, you could write the above as:


     set xmin 0; set xmax 1; set ymin 0; set ymax 1
     set just 0; set axis 0
     set xlab (x)
     set ylab (y)
     set title "The title of the graph"
     plenv $xmin $xmax $ymin $ymax $just $axis
     pllab $xlab $ylab $title

   for example. Not that there is any reason to be loquacious for its
own sake, of course. The point is that you might have things like the
plot bounds or axis labels stored in Tcl variables for some other
reason (tied to a Tk entry widget maybe, or provided as the result of
one of your application specific Tcl extension commands, etc), and just
want to use standard Tcl substitution to make the PLplot calls.

   Go ahead and try it! Enter `pltcl' to start up the PLplot extended
Tcl shell, and type (or paste) in the commands. Or put them in a file
and source it. By this point it should be clear how incredibly easy it
is to use the PLplot Tcl language binding.

   In order to accommodate the ubiquitous requirement for matrix
oriented data in scientific applications, and in the PLplot API in
particular, PLplot 5.0 includes a Tcl extension for manipulating
matrices in Tcl.  This Tcl Matrix Extension provides a straightforward
and direct means of representing one and two dimensional matrices in
Tcl. The Tcl Matrix Extension is described in detail in the next
section, but we mention its existence now just so that we can show how
the PLplot Tcl API works. Many of the PLplot Tcl API functions accept
Tcl matrices as arguments. For instance, in C you might write:


     float x[100], y[100];

     /* code to initialize x and y */

     plline( 100, x, y );

   In Tcl you can write:


     matrix x f 100
     matrix y f 100

     # code to initialize x and y

     plline 100 x y

   Some of the PLplot C function calls use pointer arguments to allow
retrieval of PLplot settings. These are implemented in Tcl by changing
the value of the variable whose name you provide. For example:


     pltcl> plgxax
     wrong # args: should be "plgxax digmax digits  "
     pltcl> set digmax 0
     0
     pltcl> set digits 0
     0
     pltcl> plgxax digmax digits
     pltcl> puts "digmax=$digmax digits=$digits"
     digmax=4 digits=0

   This example shows that each PLplot Tcl command is designed to issue
an error if you invoke it incorrectly, which in this case was used to
remind us of the correct arguments. We then create two Tcl variables to
hold the results. Then we invoke the PLplot `plgxax' function to obtain
the label formatting information for the x axis. And finally we print
the results.

   People familiar with Tcl culture may wonder why the `plg*' series
functions don't just pack their results into the standard Tcl result
string. The reason is that the user would then have to extract the
desired field with either `lindex' or `regexp', which seems messy. So
instead, we designed the PLplot Tcl API to look and feel as much like
the C API as could reasonably be managed.

   In general then, you can assume that each C function is provided in
Tcl with the same name and same arguments (and one or two dimensional
arrays in C are replaced by Tcl matrices). There are only a few
exceptions to this rule, generally resulting from the complexity of the
argument types which are passed to some functions in the C API.  Those
exceptional functions are described below, all others work in the
obvious way (analogous to the examples above).

   See the Tcl example programs for extensive demonstrations of the
usage of the PLplot Tcl API. To run the Tcl demos:


     % pltcl
     pltcl> source tcldemos.tcl
     pltcl> 1
     pltcl> 2

   Alternatively, you can run `plserver' and source `tkdemos.tcl'.

   In any event, the Tcl demos provide very good coverage of the Tcl
API, and consequently serve as excellent examples of usage. For the most
part they draw the same plots as their C counterpart. Moreover, many of
them were constructed by literally inserting the C code into the Tcl
source file, and performing fairly mechanical transformations on the
source. This should provide encouragement to anyone used to using
PLplot through one of the compiled interfaces, that they can easily and
rapidly become productive with PLplot in Tcl.

11.3 The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension
====================================

Tcl does many things well, but handling collections of numbers is not
one of them. You could make lists, but for data sets of sizes relevant
to scientific graphics which is the primary domain of applicability for
PLplot, the extraction time is excessive and burdensome. You could use
Tcl arrays, but the storage overhead is astronomical and the lookup
time, while better than list manipulation, is still prohibitive.

   To cope with this, a Tcl Matrix extension was created for the
purpose of making it feasible to work with large collections of numbers
in Tcl, in a way which is storage efficient, reasonably efficient for
accesses from Tcl, and reasonably compatible with practices used in
compiled code.

11.3.1 Using Tcl Matrices from Tcl
----------------------------------

Much like the Tk widget creation commands, the Tcl `matrix' command
considers its first argument to be the name of a new command to be
created, and the rest of the arguments to be modifiers. After the name,
the next argument can be `float' or `int' or contractions thereof. Next
follow a variable number of size arguments which determine the size of
the matrix in each of its dimensions. For example:


     matrix x f 100
     matrix y i 64 64

   constructs two matrices. `x' is a float matrix, with one dimension
and 100 elements. `y' is an integer matrix, and has 2 dimensions each
of size 64.

   Additionally, an initializer may be specified, with a syntax familiar
from C. For example:


     matrix x f 4 = { 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 }

   A Tcl matrix is a command, and as longtime Tcl users know, Tcl
commands are globally accessible. The PLplot Tcl Matrix extension
attempts to lessen the impact of this by registering a variable in the
local scope, and tracing it for insets, and deleting the actual matrix
command when the variable goes out of scope. In this way, a Tcl matrix
appears to work sort of like a variable. It is, however, just an
illusion, so you have to keep this in mind. In particular, you may want
the matrix to outlive the scope in which it was created.  For example,
you may want to create a matrix, load it with data, and then pass it
off to a Tk megawidget for display in a spreadsheet like form. The proc
which launches the Tk megawidget will complete, but the megawidget, and
the associated Tcl matrix are supposed to hang around until they are
explicitly destroyed. To achieve this effect, create the Tcl matrix
with the `-persist' flag. If present (can be anywhere on the line), the
matrix is not automatically deleted when the scope of the current proc
(method) ends. Instead, you must explicitly clean up by using either
the 'delete' matrix command or renaming the matrix command name to {}.
Now works correctly from within [incr Tcl].

   As mentioned above, the result of creating a matrix is that a new
command of the given name is added to the interpreter. You can then
evaluate the command, providing indices as arguments, to extract the
data. For example:


     pltcl> matrix x f = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5}
     insufficient dimensions given for Matrix operator "x"
     pltcl> matrix x f 4 = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5}
     pltcl> x 0
     1.500000
     pltcl> x 1
     2.500000
     pltcl> x 3
     4.500000
     pltcl> x *
     1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000
     pltcl> puts "x\[1\]=[x 1]"
     x[1]=2.500000
     pltcl> puts "x\[*\] = :[x *]:"
     x[*] = :1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000:
     pltcl> foreach v [x *] { puts $v }
     1.500000
     2.500000
     3.500000
     4.500000
     pltcl> for {set i 0} {$i < 4} {incr i} {
                if {[x $i] < 3} {puts [x $i]} }
     1.500000
     2.500000

   Note from the above that the output of evaluating a matrix indexing
operation is suitable for use in condition processing, list processing,
etc.

   You can assign to matrix locations in a similar way:


     pltcl> x 2 = 7
     pltcl> puts ":[x *]:"
     :1.500000 2.500000 7.000000 4.500000:
     pltcl> x * = 3
     pltcl> puts ":[x *]:"

   Note that the * provides a means of obtaining an index range, and
that it must be separated from the = by a space. Future versions of the
Tcl Matrix extension may allow alternative ways of specifying index
ranges and may assign the obvious meaning to an expression of the form:


     x *= 3

   However this has not been implemented yet...

   In any event, the `matrix' command also supports an `info'
subcommand which reports the number of elements in each dimension:


     pltcl> x info
     4
     pltcl> matrix y i 8 10
     pltcl> y info
     8 10

11.3.2 Using Tcl Matrices from C
--------------------------------

Normally you will create a matrix in Tcl, and then want to pass it to C
in order to have the data filled in, or existing data to be used in a
computation, etc. To do this, pass the name of the matrix command as an
argument to your C Tcl command procedure. The C code should include
`tclMatrix.h', which has a definition for the `tclMatrix' structure.
You fetch a pointer to the `tclMatrix' structure using the
`Tcl_GetMatrixPtr' function.

   For example, in Tcl:


     matrix x f 100
     wacky x

   and in C:


     int wackyCmd( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                   int argc, char *argv[] )
     {
         tclMatrix *w;

         w = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
         ...

   To learn about what else you can do with the matrix once inside
compiled code, read `tclMatrix.h' to learn the definition of the
`tclMatrix' structure, and see the examples in files like `tclAPI.c'
which show many various uses of the Tcl matrix.

11.3.3 Using Tcl Matrices from C++
----------------------------------

Using a Tcl matrix from C++ is very much like using it from C, except
that `tclMatrix.h' contains some C++ wrapper classes which are somewhat
more convenient than using the indexing macros which one has to use in
C. For example, here is a tiny snippet from one of the authors codes in
which Tcl matrices are passed in from Tcl to a C++ routine which is
supposed to fill them in with values from some matrices used in the
compiled side of the code:


     ...
     if (item == "vertex_coords") {
         tclMatrix *matxg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
         tclMatrix *matyg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[2] );

         Mat2<float> xg(ncu, ncv), yg(ncu, ncv);
         cg->Get_Vertex_Coords( xg, yg );

         TclMatFloat txg( matxg ), tyg( matyg );

         for( i=0; i < ncu; i++ )
             for( j=0; j < ncv; j++ ) {
                 txg(i,j) = xg(i,j);
                 tyg(i,j) = yg(i,j);
             }

   There are other things you can do too, see the definitions of the
`TclMatFloat' and `TclMatInt' classes in `tclMatrix.h'.

11.3.4 Extending the Tcl Matrix facility
----------------------------------------

The Tcl matrix facility provides creation, indexing, and information
gathering facilities. However, considering the scientifically inclined
PLplot user base, it is clear that some users will demand more.
Consequently there is a mechanism for augmenting the Tcl matrix
facility with your own, user defined, extension subcommands. Consider
`xtk04.c'. In this extended wish, we want to be able to determine the
minimum and maximum values stored in a matrix. Doing this in Tcl would
involve nested loops, which in Tcl would be prohibitively slow. We
could register a Tcl extension command to do it, but since the only
sensible data for such a command would be a Tcl matrix, it seems nice
to provide this facility as an actual subcommand of the matrix.
However, the PLplot maintainers cannot foresee every need, so a
mechanism is provided to register subcommands for use with matrix
objects.

   The way to register matrix extension subcommands is to call
`Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn':


     typedef int (*tclMatrixXtnsnProc) ( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                                         int argc, char *argv[] );

     int Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( char *cmd, tclMatrixXtnsnProc proc );

   In other words, make a function for handling the matrix extension
subcommand, with the same function signature (prototype) as
`tclMatrixXtnsnProc', and register the subcommand name along with the
function pointer. For example, xtk04.c has:


     int mat_max( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                  int argc, char *argv[] )
     {
         float max = pm->fdata[0];
         int i;
         for( i=1; i < pm->len; i++ )
             if (pm->fdata[i] > max)
                 max = pm->fdata[i];

         sprintf( interp->result, "%f", max );
         return TCL_OK;
     }

     int mat_min( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                  int argc, char *argv[] )
     {
         float min = pm->fdata[0];
         int i;
         for( i=1; i < pm->len; i++ )
             if (pm->fdata[i] < min)
                 min = pm->fdata[i];

         sprintf( interp->result, "%f", min );
         return TCL_OK;
     }

   Then, inside the application initialization function
(`Tcl_AppInit()' to long time Tcl users):


     Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "max", mat_max );
     Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "min", mat_min );

   Then we can do things like:


     dino 65: xtk04
     % matrix x f 4 = {1, 2, 3, 1.5}
     % x min
     1.000000
     % x max
     3.000000

   Your imagination is your only limit for what you can do with this.
You could add an FFT subcommand, matrix math, BLAS, whatever.

11.4 Contouring and Shading from Tcl
====================================

Contouring and shading has traditionally been one of the messier things
to do in PLplot. The C API has many parameters, with complex setup and
tear down properties. Of special concern is that some of the parameters
do not have a natural representation in script languages like Tcl. In
this section we describe how the Tcl interface to these facilities is
provided, and how to use it.

* Menu:

* Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl::
* Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl::


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl,  Next: Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl,  Up: Contouring and Shading from Tcl

11.4.1 Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl
--------------------------------------

By way of reference, the primary C function call for contouring is:


     void plcont( PLFLT **f, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLINT kx, PLINT lx,
                  PLINT ky, PLINT ly, PLFLT *clevel, PLINT nlevel,
                  void (*pltr) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer),
                  PLPointer pltr_data);

   This is a fairly complex argument list, and so for this function (and
for plshade, described below) we dispense with trying to exactly mirror
the C API, and just concentrate on capturing the functionality within a
Tcl context. To begin with, the data is provided through a 2-d Tcl
matrix. The Tcl matrix carries along its size information with it, so
`nx' and `ny' are no longer needed. The `kx', `lx', `ky' and `ly'
variables are potentially still useful for plotting a subdomain of the
full data set, so they may be specified in the natural way, but we make
this optional since they are frequently not used to convey anything more
than what could be inferred from `nx' and `ny'. However, to simplify
processing, they must be supplied or omitted as a set (all of them, or
none of them). `clevel' is supplied as a 1-d Tcl matrix, and so
`nlevel' can be omitted.

   Finally, we have no way to support function pointers from Tcl, so
instead we provide token based support for accessing the three
coordinate transformation routines which are provided by PLplot, and
which many PLplot users use. There are thus three courses of action:

   * Provide no pltr specification. In this case, `pltr0' is used by
     default.

   * Specify `pltr1 x y' where x and y are 1-d Tcl matrices.  In this
     case `pltr1' will be used, and the 1-d arrays which it needs will
     be supplied from the Tcl matrices `x' and `y'.

   * Specify `pltr2 x y' where x and y are 2-d Tcl matrices.  In this
     case `pltr2' will be used, and the 2-d arrays which it needs will
     be supplied from the Tcl matrices `x' and `y'.

   Now, there can be no question that this is both more concise and less
powerful than what you could get in C. The loss of the ability to
provide a user specified transformation function is regrettable. If you
really do need that functionality, you will have to implement your own
Tcl extension command to do pretty much the same thing as the provided
Tcl extension command `plcont' (which is in `tclAPI.c' in function
`plcontCmd()'), except specify the C transformation function of your
choice.

   However, that having been said, we recognize that one common use for
this capability is to provide a special version of `pltr2' which knows
how to implement a periodic boundary condition, so that polar plots,
for example, can be implemented cleanly. That is, if you want to draw
contours of a polar data set defined on a 64 x 64 grid, ensuring that
contour lines would actually go all the way around the origin rather
than breaking off like a silly pacman figure, then you had basically
two choices in C. You could copy the data to a 65 x 64 grid, and
replicate one row of data into the spare slot, and then plot the larger
data set (taking care to replicate the coordinate arrays you passed to
pltr2 in the same way), or you could make a special version of `pltr2'
which would understand that one of the coordinates was wrapped, and
perform transformations accordingly without actually making you
replicate the data.

   Since the former option is ugly in general, and hard to do in Tcl in
particular, and since the second option is even more difficult to do in
Tcl (requiring you do make a special Tcl extension command as described
above), we provide special, explicit support for this common activity.
This is provided through the use of a new, optional parameter `wrap'
which may be specified as the last parameter to the Tcl command, only
if you are using `pltr2'. Supplying `1' will wrap in the first
coordinate, `2' will wrap in the second coordinate.

   The resultant Tcl command is:


     plcont f [kx lx ky ly] clev [pltr x y] [wrap]

   Note that the brackets here are used to signify optional arguments,
not to represent Tcl command substitution!

   The Tcl demo `x09.tcl' provides examples of all the capabilities of
this interface to contouring from Tcl. Note in particular, `x09_polar'
which does a polar contour without doing anything complicated in the
way of setup, and without getting a pacman as the output.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl,  Prev: Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl,  Up: Contouring and Shading from Tcl

11.4.2 Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl
-------------------------------------

The Tcl interface to shading works very much like the one for
contouring. The command is:


     plshade z xmin xmax ymin ymax \
         sh_min sh_max sh_cmap sh_color sh_width \
         min_col min_wid max_col max_wid \
         rect [pltr x y] [wrap]

   where `nx' and `ny' were dropped since they are inferred from the
Tcl matrix `z', `defined' was dropped since it isn't supported anyway,
and `plfill' was dropped since it was the only valid choice anyway. The
`pltr' spec and `wrap' work exactly as described for the Tcl `plcont'
described above.

   The Tcl demo `x16.tcl' contains extensive demonstrations of use,
including a shaded polar plot which connects in the desirable way
without requiring special data preparation, again just like for
`plcont' described previously.

11.5 Understanding the Performance Characteristics of Tcl
=========================================================

Newcomers to Tcl, and detractors (read, proponents of other paradigms)
often do not have a clear (newcomers) or truthful (detractors)
perspective on Tcl performance. In this section we try to convey a
little orientation which may be helpful in working with the PLplot Tcl
interface.

   Tcl is slow! Yeah, so what?

   Debates of this form frequently completely miss the point. Yes, Tcl
is definitely slow. It is fundamentally a string processing language,
is interpreted, and must perform substitutions and so forth on a
continual basis. All of that takes time. Think milliseconds instead of
microseconds for comparing Tcl code to equivalent C code. On the other
hand, this does not have to be problematic, even for time critical
(interactive) applications, if the division of labor is done correctly.
Even in an interactive program, you can use Tcl fairly extensively for
high level control type operations, as long as you do the real work in
a compiled Tcl command procedure. If the high level control code is
slow, so what? So it takes 100 milliseconds over the life the process,
as compared to the 100 microseconds it could have taken if it were in
C. Big deal. On an absolute time scale, measured in units meaningful to
humans, it's just not a lot of time.

   The problem comes when you try to do too much in Tcl. For instance,
an interactive process should not be trying to evaluate a mathematical
expression inside a doubly nested loop structure, if performance is
going to be a concern.

   Case in point: Compare x16.tcl to x16c.c. The code looks very
similar, and the output looks very similar. What is not so similar is
the execution time. The Tcl code, which sets up the data entirely in
Tcl, takes a while to do so. On the other hand, the actual plotting of
the data proceeds at a rate which is effectively indistinguishable from
that of the compiled example. On human time scales, the difference is
not meaningful. Conclusion: If the computation of the data arrays could
be moved to compiled code, the two programs would have performance
close enough to identical that it really wouldn't be an issue. We left
the Tcl demos coded in Tcl for two reasons. First because they provide
some examples and tests of the use of the Tcl Matrix extension, and
secondly because they allow the Tcl demos to be coded entirely in Tcl,
without requiring special customized extended shells for each one of
them. They are not, however, a good example of you should do things in
practice.

   Now look at `tk04' and `xtk04.c', you will see that if the data is
computed in compiled code, and shuffled into the Tcl matrix and then
plotted from Tcl, the performance is fine. Almost all the time is spent
in plshade, in compiled code. The time taken to do the small amount of
Tcl processing involved with plotting is dwarfed by the time spent
doing the actual drawing in C. So using Tcl cost almost nothing in this
case.

   So, the point is, do your heavy numerics in a compiled language, and
feel free to use Tcl for the plotting, if you want to. You can of
course mix it up so that some plotting is done from Tcl and some from a
compiled language.

12 Building an Extended WISH
****************************

Beginning with PLplot 5.0, a new and powerful paradigm for interaction
with PLplot is introduced. This new paradigm consists of an integration
of PLplot with a powerful scripting language (Tcl), and extensions to
that language to support X Windows interface development (Tk) and
object oriented programming ([incr Tcl]). Taken together, these four
software systems (Tcl/Tk/itcl/PLplot) comprise a powerful environment
for the rapid prototyping and development of sophisticated, flexible, X
Windows applications with access to the PLplot API. Yet that is only
the beginning--Tcl was born to be extended. The true power of this
paradigm is achieved when you add your own, powerful, application
specific extensions to the above quartet, thus creating an environment
for the development of wholly new applications with only a few
keystrokes of shell programming ...

12.1 Introduction to Tcl
========================

The Tool Command Language, or just Tcl (pronounced tickle) is an
embeddable script language which can be used to control a wide variety
of applications. Designed by John Ousterhout of UC Berkeley, Tcl is
freely available under the standard Berkeley copyright. Tcl and Tk
(described below) are extensively documented in a new book published by
Addison Wesley, entitled Tcl and the Tk toolkit by John Ousterhout.
This book is a must have for those interested in developing powerful
extensible applications with high quality X Windows user interfaces. The
discussion in this chapter cannot hope to approach the level of
introduction provided by that book. Rather we will concentrate on
trying to convey some of the excitement, and show the nuts and bolts of
using Tcl and some extensions to provide a powerful and flexible
interface to the PLplot library within your application.

12.1.1 Motivation for Tcl
-------------------------

The central observation which led Ousterhout to create Tcl was the
realization that many applications require the use of some sort of a
special purpose, application specific, embedded macro language.
Application programmers cobble these tiny languages into their codes in
order to provide flexibility and some modicum of high level control.
But the end result is frequently a quirky and fragile language. And
each application has a different tiny language associated with it. The
idea behind Tcl, then, was to create a single core language which could
be easily embedded into a wide variety of applications. Further, it
should be easily extensible so that individual applications can easily
provide application specific capabilities available in the macro
language itself, while still providing a robust, uniform syntax across
a variety of applications. To say that Tcl satisfies these requirements
would be a spectacular understatement.

12.1.2 Capabilities of Tcl
--------------------------

The mechanics of using Tcl are very straightforward. Basically you just
have to include the file `tcl.h', issue some API calls to create a Tcl
interpreter, and then evaluate a script file or perform other
operations supported by the Tcl API.  Then just link against `libtcl.a'
and off you go.

   Having done this, you have essentially created a shell. That is, your
program can now execute shell scripts in the Tcl language. Tcl provides
support for basic control flow, variable substitution file i/o and
subroutines. In addition to the builtin Tcl commands, you can define
your own subroutines as Tcl procedures which effectively become new
keywords.

   But the real power of this approach is to add new commands to the
interpreter which are realized by compiled C code in your application.
Tcl provides a straightforward API call which allows you to register a
function in your code to be called whenever the interpreter comes
across a specific keyword of your choosing in the shell scripts it
executes.

   This facility allows you with tremendous ease, to endow your
application with a powerful, robust and full featured macro language,
trivially extend that macro language with new keywords which trigger
execution of compiled application specific commands, and thereby raise
the level of interaction with your code to one of essentially shell
programming via script editing.

12.1.3 Acquiring Tcl
--------------------

There are several important sources of info and code for Tcl.
Definitely get the book mentioned above. The Tcl and Tk toolkits are
distributed by anonymous `ftp' at `sprite.berkeley.edu:/tcl'
(ftp://sprite.berkeley.edu/tcl).  There are several files in there
corresponding to Tcl, Tk, and various forms of documentation. At the
time of this writing, the current versions of Tcl and Tk are 7.3 and
3.6 respectively.  Retrieve those files, and install using the
instructions provided therein.

   The other major anonymous `ftp' site for Tcl is
`harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/pub/tcl' (ftp://harbor.ecn.purdue.edu/pub/tcl).
Harbor contains a mirror of `sprite' as well as innumerable extensions,
Tcl/Tk packages, tutorials, documentation, etc. The level of excitement
in the Tcl community is extraordinarily high, and this is reflected by
the great plethora of available, high quality, packages and extensions
available for use with Tcl and Tk. Explore--there is definitely
something for everyone.

   Additionally there is a newsgroup, `comp.lang.tcl' which is well
read, and an excellent place for people to get oriented, find help,
etc. Highly recommended.

   In any event, in order to use the Tk driver in PLplot, you will need
Tcl-8.2 and Tk-8.2 (or higher versions). Additionally, in order to use
the extended WISH paradigm (described below) you will need iTcl-3.1 (or
a higher version).

   However, you will quite likely find Tcl/Tk to be very addictive, and
the great plethora of add-ons available at `harbor' will undoubtedly
attract no small amount of your attention. It has been our experience
that all of these extensions fit together very well. You will find that
there are large sectors of the Tcl user community which create so-called
MegaWishes which combine many of the available extensions into a
single, heavily embellished, shell interpreter.  The benefits of this
approach will become apparent as you gain experience with Tcl and Tk.

12.2 Introduction to Tk
=======================

As mentioned above, Tcl is designed to be extensible. The first and
most basic Tcl extension is Tk, an X11 toolkit. Tk provides the same
basic facilities that you may be familiar with from other X11 toolkits
such as Athena and Motif, except that they are provided in the context
of the Tcl language. There are C bindings too, but these are seldom
needed--the vast majority of useful Tk applications can be coded using
Tcl scripts.

   If it has not become obvious already, it is worth noting at this
point that Tcl is one example of a family of languages known generally
as Very High Level Languages, or VHLL's.  Essentially a VHLL raises the
level of programming to a very high level, allowing very short token
streams to accomplish as much as would be required by many scores of
the more primitive actions available in a basic HLL. Consider, for
example, the basic Hello World! application written in Tcl/Tk.


     #!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

     button .hello -text "Hello World!"  -command "destroy ."
     pack .hello

   That's it! That's all there is to it. If you have ever programmed X
using a traditional toolkit such as Athena or Motif, you can appreciate
how amazingly much more convenient this is. If not, you can either take
our word for it that this is 20 times less code than you would need to
use a standard toolkit, or you can go write the same program in one of
the usual toolkits and see for yourself...

   We cannot hope to provide a thorough introduction to Tk programming
in this section. Instead, we will just say that immensely complex
applications can be constructed merely by programming in exactly the
way shown in the above script. By writing more complex scripts, and by
utilizing the additional widgets provided by Tk, one can create
beautiful, extensive user interfaces. Moreover, this can be done in a
tiny fraction of the time it takes to do the same work in a
conventional toolkit. Literally minutes versus days.

   Tk provides widgets for labels, buttons, radio buttons, frames with
or without borders, menubars, pull downs, toplevels, canvases, edit
boxes, scroll bars, etc.

   A look at the interface provided by the PLplot Tk driver should help
give you a better idea of what you can do with this paradigm. Also
check out some of the contributed Tcl/Tk packages available at harbor.
There are high quality Tk interfaces to a great many familiar Unix
utilities ranging from mail to info, to SQL, to news, etc. The list is
endless and growing fast...

12.3 Introduction to [incr Tcl]
===============================

Another extremely powerful and popular extension to Tcl is [incr Tcl].
[incr Tcl] is to Tcl what C++ is to C. The analogy is very extensive.
Itcl provides an object oriented extension to Tcl supporting clustering
of procedures and data into what is called an `itcl_class'. An
`itcl_class' can have methods as well as instance data. And they
support inheritance.  Essentially if you know how C++ relates to C, and
if you know Tcl, then you understand the programming model provided by
Itcl.

   In particular, you can use Itcl to implement new widgets which are
composed of more basic Tk widgets. A file selector is an example.
Using Tk, one can build up a very nice file selector comprised of more
basic Tk widgets such as entries, listboxes, scrollbars, etc.

   But what if you need two file selectors? You have to do it all
again. Or what if you need two different kinds of file selectors, you
get to do it again and add some incremental code.

   This is exactly the sort of thing object orientation is intended to
assist. Using Itcl you can create an `itcl_class FileSelector' and then
you can instantiate them freely as easily as:


         FileSelector .fs1
         .fs1 -dir . -find "*.cc"

   and so forth.

   These high level widgets composed of smaller Tk widgets, are known as
megawidgets. There is a developing subculture of the Tcl/Tk community
for designing and implementing megawidgets, and [incr Tcl] is the most
popular enabling technology.

   In particular, it is the enabling technology which is employed for
the construction of the PLplot Tcl extensions, described below.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: PLplot Extensions to Tcl,  Next: Custom Extensions to Tcl,  Prev: Introduction to [incr Tcl],  Up: Building an Extended WISH

12.4 PLplot Extensions to Tcl
=============================

Following the paradigm described above, PLplot provides extensions to
Tcl as well, designed to allow the use of PLplot from Tcl/Tk programs.
Essentially the idea here is to allow PLplot programmers to achieve two
goals:

   * To access PLplot facilities from their own extended WISH and/or
     Tcl/Tk user interface scripts.

   * To have PLplot display its output in a window integrated directly
     into the rest of their Tcl/Tk interface.

   For instance, prior to PLplot 5.0, if a programmer wanted to use
PLplot in a Tcl/Tk application, the best he could manage was to call
the PLplot C API from compiled C code, and get the output via the Xwin
driver, which would display in it's own toplevel window. In other
words, there was no integration, and the result was pretty sloppy.

   With PLplot 5.0, there is now a supported Tcl interface to PLplot
functionality. This is provided through a family of PLplot megawidgets
implemented in [incr Tcl]. Using this interface, a programmer can get a
PLplot window/widget into a Tk interface as easily as:


     PLWin .plw
     pack .plw

   Actually, there's the update/init business--need to clear that up.

   The `PLWin' class then mirrors much of the PLplot C API, so that a
user can generate plots in the PLplot widget entirely from Tcl. This is
demonstrated in the `tk02' demo,


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: Custom Extensions to Tcl,  Prev: PLplot Extensions to Tcl,  Up: Building an Extended WISH

12.5 Custom Extensions to Tcl
=============================

By this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of the
underlying philosophy of Tcl and Tk, and the whole concept of
extensions, of which [incr Tcl] and PLplot are examples. These alone
are enough to allow the rapid prototyping and development of powerful,
flexible graphical applications. Normally the programmer simply writes
a shell script to be executed by the Tk windowing shell, `wish'. It is
in vogue for each Tcl/Tk extension package to build it's own extended
WISH.  There are many examples of this, and indeed even PLplot's
`plserver' program, described in an earlier chapter, could just as
easily have been called `plwish'.

   In any event, as exciting and useful as these standalone, extended
windowing shells may be, they are ultimately only the beginning of what
you can do. The real benefit of this approach is realized when you make
your own extended WISH, comprised of Tcl, Tk, any of the standard
extensions you like, and finally embellished with a smattering of
application specific extensions designed to support your own
application domain. In this section we give a detailed introduction to
the process of constructing your own WISH. After that, you're on your
own...

File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: WISH Construction,  Next: WISH Linking,  Up: Custom Extensions to Tcl

12.5.1 WISH Construction
------------------------

The standard way to make your own WISH, as supported by the Tcl/Tk
system, is to take a boilerplate file, `tkAppInit.c', edit to reflect
the Tcl/Tk extensions you will be requiring, add some commands to the
interpreter, and link it all together.

   Here for example is the important part of the `tk02' demo, extracted
from the file `xtk02.c', which is effectively the extended WISH
definition file for the `tk02' demo.  Comments and other miscellany are
omitted.


     #include "tk.h"
     #include "itcl.h"

     /* ... */

     int   myplotCmd        (ClientData, Tcl_Interp *, int, char **);

     int
     Tcl_AppInit(interp)
         Tcl_Interp *interp;		/* Interpreter for application. */
     {
     int   plFrameCmd        (ClientData, Tcl_Interp *, int, char **);

         Tk_Window main;

         main = Tk_MainWindow(interp);

         /*
          * Call the init procedures for included packages.  Each call should
          * look like this:
          *
          * if (Mod_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
          *     return TCL_ERROR;
          * }
          *
          * where "Mod" is the name of the module.
          */

         if (Tcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
             return TCL_ERROR;
         }
         if (Tk_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
             return TCL_ERROR;
         }
         if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
             return TCL_ERROR;
         }
         if (Pltk_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
             return TCL_ERROR;
         }

         /*
          * Call Tcl_CreateCommand for application-specific commands, if
          * they weren't already created by the init procedures called above.
          */

         Tcl_CreateCommand(interp, "myplot", myplotCmd,
                           (ClientData) main, (void (*)(ClientData)) NULL);


         /*
          * Specify a user-specific startup file to invoke if the
          * application is run interactively.  Typically the startup
          * file is "~/.apprc" where "app" is the name of the application.
          * If this line is deleted then no user-specific startup file
          * will be run under any conditions.
          */

         tcl_RcFileName = "~/.wishrc";
         return TCL_OK;
     }

     /* ... myPlotCmd, etc ... */

   The calls to `Tcl_Init()' and `Tk_Init()' are in every WISH. To make
an extended WISH, you add calls to the initialization routines for any
extension packages you want to use, in this [incr Tcl] (`Itcl_Init()')
and PLplot (`Pltk_Init()'). Finally you add keywords to the
interpreter, associating them with functions in your code using
`Tcl_CreateCommand()' as shown.

   In particular, PLplot has a number of [incr Tcl] classes in its Tcl
library. If you want to be able to use those in your WISH, you need to
include the initialization of [incr Tcl].


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: WISH Linking,  Next: WISH Programming,  Prev: WISH Construction,  Up: Custom Extensions to Tcl

12.5.2 WISH Linking
-------------------

Having constructed your `Tcl_AppInit()' function, you now merely need
to link this file with your own private files to provide the code for
any functions you registered via `Tcl_CreateCommand()' (and any they
depend on), against the Tcl, Tk and extension libraries you are using.


     cc -c tkAppInit.c
     cc -c mycommands.c
     cc -o my_wish tkAppInit.o mycommands.o
                -lplplotftk -ltcl -ltk -litcl -lX11 -lm

   Add any needed `-L' options as needed.

   Voila! You have made a wish.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: WISH Programming,  Prev: WISH Linking,  Up: Custom Extensions to Tcl

12.5.3 WISH Programming
-----------------------

Now you are ready to put the genie to work. The basic plan here is to
write shell scripts which use your new application specific windowing
shell as their interpreter, to implement X Windows user interfaces to
control and utilize the facilities made available in your extensions.

   Effectively this just comes down to writing Tcl/Tk code, embellished
as appropriate with calls to the extension commands you registered.
Additionally, since this wish includes the PLplot extensions, you can
instantiate any of the PLplot family of [incr Tcl] classes, and invoke
methods on those objects to effect the drawing of graphs.  Similarly,
you may have your extension commands (which are coded in C) call the
PLplot C programmers API to draw into the widget. In this way you can
have the best of both worlds. Use compiled C code when the
computational demands require the speed of compiled code, or use Tcl
when your programming convenience is more important than raw speed.

13.1 The PlplotCanvas Widget for Gnome/GTK Applications
=======================================================

Plots can be embedded into Gnome/GTK applications by using the
PlplotCanvas widget. Information on the GTK toolkit is provided at
http://www.gtk.org/. PlplotCanvas is a subclass of the GnomeCanvas (see
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/libgnomecanvas/index.html), and
so includes all of its functionality. The specialized C API for
PlplotCanvas is described in *Note PlplotCanvas API: PlplotCanvas API.,
and bindings to other languages are described in *** NEEDS
DOCUMENTATION ***.

* Menu:

* PlplotCanvas Basics::
* PlplotCanvas API::
* PlplotCanvas Examples::


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: PlplotCanvas Basics,  Next: PlplotCanvas API,  Up: The PlplotCanvas Widget for Gnome/GTK Applications

13.1.1 PlplotCanvas Basics
--------------------------

The method declarations and data structures are defined in
`plplotcanvas.h'. Programs using the PlplotCanvas widget must be linked
against the `libplplotgnome2d' library rather than `libplplotd'. This
is most easily accomplished using pkg-config; i.e.,


             gcc plplotcanvas_demo.c -o plplotcanvas_demo `pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd-gnome2`

You may need to remind pkg-config where to look for the
`plplotd-gnome2.pc' file installed by PLplot; e.g.,


             gcc plplotcanvas_demo.c -o plplotcanvas_demo `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd-gnome2`

   A specialized API is provided for PlplotCanvas and is described in
*Note PlplotCanvas API: PlplotCanvas API.. The API provides methods to
create and manipulate PlplotCanvas widgets, in addition to
object-oriented analogues for each of the PLplot functions.

   Example programs are provided that demonstrate the use of the
PlplotCanvas widget in *Note PlplotCanvas Examples: PlplotCanvas
Examples..

13.1.2 PlplotCanvas API
-----------------------

The PlplotCanvas methods are as follows. Because PlplotCanvas is a GTK
widget, GLib types (gint, gdouble, gboolean, etc) are sometimes used
rather than PLplot types (PLINT, PLFLT, etc). See
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/index.html for more
information on GLib and GLib types.

.......................................................

     PlplotCanvas* plplot_canvas_new (void);

   Returns a pointer to a new PlplotCanvas widget. Methods that apply
to a PlplotCanvas are given next.

`void'
     There are no arguments for this method.

13.1.2.2 plplot_canvas_plfunc: PLplot function analogues.
.........................................................

     void plplot_canvas_plfunc(canvas, ...);

   The PLplot functions have analogue methods named like
`plplot_canvas_plfunc'. For example, the PLplot function `plline'
(*note plline; Draw a line::) maps to `plplot_canvas_plline'. The
`plplot_canvas_plfunc' methods should be used rather than the standard
PLplot API when the PlplotCanvas is used.

   Lines drawn to the canvas are not shown until the page is advanced
using `plplot_canvas_pladv'. The plot will remain on the canvas until
the next page advance.

   The PLplot `plinit' (*note plinit; Initialize PLplot::) and
`plgstrm' (*note plgstrm; Get current stream number::) functions are
not used with PlplotCanvas because the `plplot_canvas_new' function
does the necessary initialization and returns an object with a unique
stream number.

`canvas'   (`PlplotCanvas*', input)
     The canvas on which to operate.

.....................................................

     void plplot_canvas_use_pixmap(canvas, use_pixmap);

   Sets whether lines and shades are drawn to a pixmap, or instead as
vector graphics.

   Lines and shade drawn to the pixmap are not anti-aliased, and so may
appear pixelated. Vector graphics are fully anti-aliased, but are
rendered at a slower speed.

`canvas'   (`PlplotCanvas*', input)
     The PlplotCanvas to set.

13.1.2.7 plplot_canvas_use_persistence: Sets persistence  of subsequent drawing operations.
...........................................................................................

     void plplot_canvas_use_persistence (canvas, use_persistence);

   Sets whether the subsequent drawing commands are persistent, or
refreshed when the PLplot page is advanced. This feature is useful for
plot animations, because the axes can be persistent rather than redrawn
for each frame.

   Note that lines that are persistent are always anti-aliased and
drawn at the front.

..............................................................................

     PLINT plplot_canvas_get_stream_number (canvas);

   Returns the stream number for the given Canvas. Although the concept
of streams that exists in the standard PLplot API is not used here, the
stream number provides a unique ID number for the given PlplotCanvas
widget.

       /* Advancing the page finalizes this plot */
       plplot_canvas_pladv(canvas,0);

       /* Start the gtk main loop */
       gtk_main();
     }

   So, what's going on here? After the preliminaries, the GTK and the
GLib type system are initialized by calls to `gtk_init' and
`g_type_init'.  A PlplotCanvas is created using `plplot_canvas_new',
and it's size is set using `plplot_canvas_set_size'.

   Next, a window is created (`gtk_window_new'), the border is set
(`gtk_set_border_width'), and the canvas is stuffed into the window
(`gtk_container_add').

   Callback functions are installed using `g_signal_connect' so that
the window decorations respond. The window is set to display everything
using `gtk_widget_show_all'.

   Now come the PLplot analogue commands. First, the page using is
advanced using `plplot_canvas_pladv'. The pen color and width are set
with `plplot_canvas_plcol0' and `plplot_canvas_plwid',respectively. The
PLplot viewport, window, box and labels are created using
`plplot_canvas_plvpor', `plplot_canvas_plwind', `plplot_canvas_plbox'
and `plplot_canvas_pllab', respectively. A line is drawn on the canvas
using `plplot_canvas_plline', the page is advanced with
`plplot_canvas_pladv'.

   Finally, the GTK main loop is entered using `gtk_main', where it
resides until the program is exited.

14 Using PLplot from Perl
*************************

There are no proper bindings for the Perl language delivered with the
PLplot sources. However, a PLplot interface has been added to the Perl
Data Language (PDL) since version 2.4.0. If the PLplot library is
installed in the system, it is automatically detected by the PDL
configuration script, such that PLplot support for PDL should work out
of the box. For further information see the PDL homepage
(http://pdl.perl.org).

   The PDL PLplot interface (PDL::Graphics::PLplot) can interact with
PLplot in two ways: (1) A low level mapping one to one mapping of perl
functions to PLplot API functions and (2) A high level object oriented
wrapper that simplifies generating 2D plots. The PLplot source
distribution contains multiple examples of how to use the low level
interface (see examples/perl). A key thing to note is that, due to the
architecture of PDL, all the array arguments to a function come first,
followed by the scalars. This means that the argument order for some of
the functions in the PLplot API is different when called from PDL.

   Here is an usage example comparing the low level and the object
oriented interfaces to PLplot.


     use PDL;
     use PDL::Graphics::PLplot;

     my $x = pdl (0..5);
     my $y = $x ** 2;

     # low level interface

     plsdev ("xwin");
     plinit ();
     plcol0 (1);

     plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
     plline ($x, $y);

     plend ();

     # OO interface

     my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new (DEV => "xwin", );
     $pl->xyplot($x, $y, TITLE => 'X vs. Y');
     $pl->close;

   There is also a Perl PLplot interface on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)
which is not dependent on PDL.  The Perl module is called
Graphics::PLplot (http://search.cpan.org/%7Etjenness/) and is
appropriate for small data arrays. The API is very similar to the C API
except that if the number of elements in an array is required by the C
function the perl interface calculates it automatically. Also, return
values are returned and not supplied as arguments. Here is the PDL
example above translated to Graphics::PLplot:


     use Graphics::PLplot qw/ :all /;

     @x = (0..5);
     @y = map {$_ * $_} @x;

     plsdev ("xwin");
     plinit ();
     plcol0 (1);

     plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
     plline (\@x, \@y);

     plend ();

15 Using PLplot from Python
***************************

NEEDS DOCUMENTATION, but here is the short story. We currently
(February, 2001) have switched to dynamic loading of plplot following
the generic method given in the python documentation. Most (???) of the
PLplot common API has been implemented. (For a complete list see
plmodules.c and plmodules2.c).  With this dynamic method all the
xw??.py examples work fine and should be consulted for the best way to
use PLplot from python.  You may have to set PYTHONPATH to the path
where plmodule.so is located (or eventually installed). For more
information see examples/python/README

   pytkdemo and the x??.py examples it loads use the plframe widget.
Thus, this method does not currently work under dynamic loading. They
have only worked in the past using the static method with much hacking
and rebuilding of python itself. We plan to try dynamic loading of all
of PLplot (not just the plmodule.c and plmodule2.c wrappers) including
plframe (or a python-variant of this widget) into python at some future
date to see whether it is possible to get pytkdemo and the x??.py
examples working under dynamic loading, but only the individual
stand-alone xw??.py demos work at the moment.

17 The Common API for PLplot
****************************

The purpose of this chapter is to document the API for every PLplot
function that should be available across all PLplot language bindings.
This common API between the various languages constitutes the most
important part of the PLplot API that programmers need to know.  Note
that in C, these common API routines have a special c_ prefix name
assigned to them in `plplot.h'.

   What follows is a list of all common API functions of the current
CVS HEAD with their arguments except for obsolete/deprecated API
functions which are listed in *Note Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot:
Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot.. The following information is
provided for each function:

  1. The function name and a brief description.

  2. The function as it would be called from C.

  3. A complete description of the function.

  4. A description of each argument that the function takes.

  5. The redacted argument form of the function, currently used by the
     programming languages Fortran95, Python, Java and Perl, as well as
     any language specific variations that might occur on the general
     calling scheme described in the following paragraph.

  6. A list of PLplot examples that demonstrate how to use the function.

Additional PLplot API specialized for each language binding is
documented in *Note The Specialized C API for PLplot: The Specialized C
API for PLplot. and subsequent chapters.

   The general calling scheme for the other languages supported by
PLplot is as follows, using the function `plline' as an example.

   * C: `plline(n,x,y)'

   * F77: `plline(n,x,y)'

   * F95: `plline(x,y)'

   * C++: `pls->line(n,x,y)'

   * Java: `pls.line(x,y)'

   * Perl/PDL: `plline($x,$y)'

   * Python: `plline(x,y)'

   * Tcl/Tk: `$w cmd plline $n x y'

Note that in some languages the argument n (which specifies the length
of the arrays x and y) is not necessary, this is what we refer to above
as the redacted argument form of the function.

17.1 pl_setcontlabelformat: Set format of numerical label for contours
======================================================================

     pl_setcontlabelformat (lexp, sigdig);

   Set format of numerical label for contours.

`lexp'  (`PLINT', input)
     If the contour numerical label is greater than 10^(lexp) or less
     than 10^(-lexp), then the exponential format is used. Default
     value of lexp is 4.

`sigdig'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of significant digits. Default value is 2.

   Redacted form: `pl_setcontlabelformat(lexp, sigdig)'

   This function is not used in any examples.

17.2 pl_setcontlabelparam: Set parameters of contour labelling other than format of numerical label
===================================================================================================

     pl_setcontlabelparam (offset, size, spacing, active);

   Set parameters of contour labelling other than those handled by
`pl_setcontlabelformat' (*note pl_setcontlabelformat; Set format of
numerical label for contours::).

`offset'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Offset of label from contour line (if set to 0.0, labels are
     printed on the lines). Default value is 0.006.

`size'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Font height for contour labels (normalized). Default value is 0.3.

`spacing'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Spacing parameter for contour labels. Default value is 0.1.

`active'  (`PLINT', input)
     Activate labels. Set to 1 if you want contour labels on.  Default
     is off (0).

   Redacted form: `pl_setcontlabelparam(offset, size, spacing, active)'

   This function is used in example 9.

17.3 pladv: Advance the (sub-)page
==================================

     pladv (sub);

   Advances to the next subpage if ``sub'=0', performing a page advance
if there are no remaining subpages on the current page. If subpages
aren't being used, ``pladv' (*note pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::)(0)'
will always advance the page. If ``sub'>0', PLplot switches to the
specified subpage. Note that this allows you to overwrite a plot on the
specified subpage; if this is not what you intended, use `pleop' (*note
pleop; Eject current page::) followed by `plbop' (*note plbop; Begin a
new page::) to first advance the page. This routine is called
automatically (with ``sub'=0') by `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard
window and draw box::), but if `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard
window and draw box::) is not used, `pladv' (*note pladv; Advance the
[sub-]page::) must be called after initializing PLplot but before
defining the viewport.

`sub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Specifies the subpage number (starting from 1 in the top left
     corner and increasing along the rows) to which to advance. Set to
     zero to advance to the next subpage.

   Redacted form: `pladv(sub)'

   This function is used in examples 1,2,4,6-12,14-18,20,21,23-27.

17.4 plaxes: Draw a box with axes, etc. with arbitrary origin
=============================================================

     plaxes (x0, y0, xopt, xtick, nxsub, yopt, ytick, nysub);

   Draws a box around the currently defined viewport with arbitrary
world-coordinate origin specified by ``x0'' and ``y0'' and labels it
with world coordinate values appropriate to the window. Thus `plaxes'
(*note plaxes; Draw a box with axes; etc_ with arbitrary origin::)
should only be called after defining both viewport and window. The
character strings ``xopt'' and ``yopt'' specify how the box should be
drawn as described below. If ticks and/or subticks are to be drawn for
a particular axis, the tick intervals and number of subintervals may be
specified explicitly, or they may be defaulted by setting the
appropriate arguments to zero.

`x0'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World X coordinate of origin.

`y0'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World Y coordinate of origin.

`xopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for horizontal
     axis. The string can include any combination of the following
     letters (upper or lower case) in any order:

        * `a': Draws axis, X-axis is horizontal line (`y=0'), and
          Y-axis is vertical line (`x=0').

        * `b': Draws bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.

        * `c': Draws top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.

        * `f': Always use fixed point numeric labels.

        * `g': Draws a grid at the major tick interval.

        * `h': Draws a grid at the minor tick interval.

        * `i': Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn outwards, rather
          than inwards.

        * `l': Labels axis logarithmically. This only affects the
          labels, not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the
          logarithms of data points before passing them to any of the
          drawing routines.

        * `m': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the
          unconventional location (above box for X, right of box for Y).

        * `n': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the
          conventional location (below box for X, left of box for Y).

        * `s': Enables subticks between major ticks, only valid if `t'
          is also specified.

        * `t': Draws major ticks.

`xtick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the x axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nxsub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major x axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

`yopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for vertical axis.
     The string can include any combination of the letters defined
     above for ``xopt'', and in addition may contain:

        * `v': Write numeric labels for vertical axis parallel to the
          base of the graph, rather than parallel to the axis.

`ytick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the y axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nysub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major y axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

   Redacted form:

   * General: `plaxes(x0, y0, xopt, xtick, nxsub, yopt, ytick, nysub)'

   * Perl/PDL: `plaxes(x0, y0, xtick, nxsub, ytick, nysub, xopt, yopt)'

   This function is not used in any examples.

17.5 plbin: Plot a histogram from binned data
=============================================

     plbin (nbin, x, y, opt);

   Plots a histogram consisting of ``nbin'' bins. The value associated
with the `i''th bin is placed in ``x'[i]', and the number of points in
the bin is placed in ``y'[i]'. For proper operation, the values in
``x'[i]' must form a strictly increasing sequence. By default, ``x'[i]'
is the left-hand edge of the `i''th bin. If ``opt'=PL_BIN_CENTRED' is
used, the bin boundaries are placed midway between the values in the
``x'' array. Also see `plhist' (*note plhist; Plot a histogram from
unbinned data::) for drawing histograms from unbinned data.

`nbin'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of bins (i.e., number of values in ``x'' and ``y'' arrays.)

`x'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array containing values associated with bins. These
     must form a strictly increasing sequence.

`y'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array containing number of points in bin. This is a
     `PLFLT' (instead of `PLINT') array so as to allow histograms of
     probabilities, etc.

`opt'  (`PLINT', input)
     Is a combination of several flags:

        * ``opt'=PL_BIN_DEFAULT': The ``x'' represent the lower bin
          boundaries, the outer bins are expanded to fill up the entire
          x-axis and bins of zero height are simply drawn.

        * ``opt'=PL_BIN_CENTRED|...': The bin boundaries are to be
          midway between the ``x'' values. If the values in ``x'' are
          equally spaced, the values are the center values of the bins.

        * ``opt'=PL_BIN_NOEXPAND|...': The outer bins are drawn with
          equal size as the ones inside.

        * ``opt'=PL_BIN_NOEMPTY|...': Bins with zero height are not
          drawn (there is a gap for such bins).

   Redacted form:

   * General: `plbin(x, y, opt)'

   * Perl/PDL: `plbin(nbin, x, y, opt)'

   * Python: `plbin(nbin, x, y, opt)'

   This function is not used in any examples.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: plbop; Begin a new page,  Next: plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc,  Prev: plbin; Plot a histogram from binned data,  Up: The Common API for PLplot

17.6 plbop: Begin a new page
============================

     plbop ();

   Begins a new page. For a file driver, the output file is opened if
necessary. Advancing the page via `pleop' (*note pleop; Eject current
page::) and `plbop' (*note plbop; Begin a new page::) is useful when a
page break is desired at a particular point when plotting to subpages.
Another use for `pleop' (*note pleop; Eject current page::) and `plbop'
(*note plbop; Begin a new page::) is when plotting pages to different
files, since you can manually set the file name by calling `plsfnam'
(*note plsfnam; Set output file name::) after the call to `pleop'
(*note pleop; Eject current page::).  (In fact some drivers may only
support a single page per file, making this a necessity.) One way to
handle this case automatically is to page advance via `pladv' (*note
pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::), but enable familying (see `plsfam'

17.7 plbox: Draw a box with axes, etc
=====================================

     plbox (xopt, xtick, nxsub, yopt, ytick, nysub);

   Draws a box around the currently defined viewport, and labels it with
world coordinate values appropriate to the window. Thus `plbox' (*note
plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc::) should only be called after
defining both viewport and window. The character strings ``xopt'' and
``yopt'' specify how the box should be drawn as described below. If
ticks and/or subticks are to be drawn for a particular axis, the tick
intervals and number of subintervals may be specified explicitly, or
they may be defaulted by setting the appropriate arguments to zero.

`xopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for horizontal
     axis. The string can include any combination of the following
     letters (upper or lower case) in any order:

        * `a': Draws axis, X-axis is horizontal line (`y=0'), and
          Y-axis is vertical line (`x=0').

        * `b': Draws bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.

        * `c': Draws top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.

        * `f': Always use fixed point numeric labels.

        * `g': Draws a grid at the major tick interval.

        * `h': Draws a grid at the minor tick interval.

        * `i': Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn outwards, rather
          than inwards.

        * `l': Labels axis logarithmically. This only affects the
          labels, not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the
          logarithms of data points before passing them to any of the
          drawing routines.

        * `m': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the
          unconventional location (above box for X, right of box for Y).

        * `n': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the
          conventional location (below box for X, left of box for Y).

        * `s': Enables subticks between major ticks, only valid if `t'
          is also specified.

        * `t': Draws major ticks.

`xtick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the x axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nxsub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major x axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

`yopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for vertical axis.
     The string can include any combination of the letters defined
     above for ``xopt'', and in addition may contain:

        * `v': Write numeric labels for vertical axis parallel to the
          base of the graph, rather than parallel to the axis.

`ytick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the y axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nysub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major y axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

17.8 plbox3: Draw a box with axes, etc, in 3-d
==============================================

     plbox3 (xopt, xlabel, xtick, nxsub, yopt, ylabel, ytick, nysub,
     zopt, zlabel, ztick, nzsub);

   Draws axes, numeric and text labels for a three-dimensional surface
plot. For a more complete description of three-dimensional plotting see
*Note Three Dimensional Surface Plots: Three Dimensional Surface Plots..

`xopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for the x axis.
     The string can include any combination of the following letters
     (upper or lower case) in any order:

        * `b': Draws axis at base, at height `z=`zmin'' where ``zmin''
          is defined by call to `plw3d' (*note plw3d; Set up window for
          3-d plotting::). This character must be specified in order to
          use any of the other options.

        * `f': Always use fixed point numeric labels.

        * `i': Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn downwards, rather
          than upwards.

        * `l': Labels axis logarithmically. This only affects the
          labels, not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the
          logarithms of data points before passing them to any of the
          drawing routines.

        * `n': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals.

        * `s': Enables subticks between major ticks, only valid if `t'
          is also specified.

        * `t': Draws major ticks.

        * `u': If this is specified, the text label for the axis is
          written under the axis.

`xlabel'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying text label for the x axis.
     It is only drawn if `u' is in the ``xopt'' string.

`xtick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the x axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nxsub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major x axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

`yopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for the y axis.
     The string is interpreted in the same way as ``xopt''.

`ylabel'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying text label for the y axis.
     It is only drawn if `u' is in the ``yopt'' string.

`ytick'  (`PLFLT', input)
     World coordinate interval between major ticks on the y axis.  If
     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

`nysub'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of subintervals between major y axis ticks for minor ticks.
     If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable
     minor tick interval.

`zopt'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying options for the z axis.
     The string can include any combination of the following letters
     (upper or lower case) in any order:

        * `b': Draws z axis to the left of the surface plot.

        * `c': Draws z axis to the right of the surface plot.

        * `d': Draws grid lines parallel to the x-y plane behind the
          figure. These lines are not drawn until after `plot3d' (*note
          plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::) or `plmesh' (*note plmesh;
          Plot surface mesh::) are called because of the need for
          hidden line removal.

        * `f': Always use fixed point numeric labels.

        * `i': Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn away from the
          center.

        * `l': Labels axis logarithmically. This only affects the
          labels, not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the
          logarithms of data points before passing them to any of the
          drawing routines.

        * `m': Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals on the
          right-hand vertical axis.

          the right-hand axis.

`zlabel'  (`const char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying text label for the z axis.
     It is only drawn if `u' or `v' are in the ``zopt'' string.

`ztick'  (`PLFLT', input)

     it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a suitable tick
     interval.

17.9 plcalc_world: Calculate world coordinates and corresponding window index from relative device coordinates
==============================================================================================================

     plcalc_world (rx, ry, wx, wy, window);

   Calculate world coordinates, ``wx'' and ``wy'', and corresponding
``window'' index from relative device coordinates, ``rx'' and ``ry''.

`rx'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Input relative device coordinate (ranging from 0. to 1.) for the x
     coordinate.

`ry'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Input relative device coordinate (ranging from 0. to 1.) for the y
     coordinate.

`wx'  (`PLFLT *', output)
     Pointer to the returned world coordinate for x corresponding to
     the relative device coordinates ``rx'' and ``ry''.

`wy'  (`PLFLT *', output)
     Pointer to the returned world coordinate for y corresponding to
     the relative device coordinates ``rx'' and ``ry''.

`window'  (`PLINT *', output)
     Pointer to the returned last defined window index that corresponds
     to the input relative device coordinates (and the returned world
     coordinates). To give some background on the window index, for
     each page the initial window index is set to zero, and each time
     `plwind' (*note plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport
     boundaries::) is called within the page, world and device
     coordinates are stored for the window and the window index is
     incremented. Thus, for a simple page layout with non-overlapping
     viewports and one window per viewport, ``window'' corresponds to
     the viewport index (in the order which the viewport/windows were
     created) of the only viewport/window corresponding to ``rx'' and
     ``ry''. However, for more complicated layouts with potentially
     overlapping viewports and possibly more than one window (set of
     world coordinates) per viewport, ``window'' and the corresponding
     output world coordinates corresponds to the last window created
     that fulfils the criterion that the relative device coordinates
     are inside it. Finally, in all cases where the input relative
     device coordinates are not inside any viewport/window, then
     ``window'' is set to -1.

17.10 plclear: Clear current (sub)page
======================================

     plclear ();

   Clears the current page, effectively erasing everything that have
been drawn. This command only works with interactive drivers; if the
driver does not support this, the page is filled with the background
color in use.  If the current page is divided into subpages, only the
current subpage is erased. The nth subpage can be selected with `pladv'
(*note pladv; Advance the [sub-]page::)(n).
