.SH NAME
\fBplmeshc\fP - Magnitude colored plot surface mesh with contour. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplmeshc\fP(\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIz\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP, \fIopt\fP, \fIclevel\fP, \fInlevel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Identical to \fBplmesh\fP but with extra functionalities: the surface mesh can be colored accordingly to the current z value being plotted, a contour plot can be drawn at the base XY plane, and a curtain can be drawn between the plotted function border and the base XY plane. 
.P
Redacted form: \fBplmeshc(x, y, z, opt, clevel)\fP
.P
This function is used in example 11. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIx\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to set of x coordinate values at which the function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIy\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to set of y coordinate values at which the function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIz\fP (PLFLT **, input) 
Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array with set of function values. 
.TP
\fInx\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of \fIx\fP values at which function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIny\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of \fIy\fP values at which function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIopt\fP (PLINT, input) 
Determines the way in which the surface is represented. To specify more than one option just add the options, e.g. DRAW_LINEXY + MAG_COLOR \fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEX: Lines are drawn showing \fIz\fP as a function of \fIx\fP for each value of \fIy\fP[j]. 
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEY: Lines are drawn showing \fIz\fP as a function of \fIy\fP for each value of \fIx\fP[i]. 
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEXY: Network of lines is drawn connecting points at which function is defined. 
\fIopt\fP=MAG_COLOR: Each line in the mesh is colored according to the z value being plotted. The color is used from the current colormap 1. 
\fIopt\fP=BASE_CONT: A contour plot is drawn at the base XY plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP. 
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_SIDES: draws a curtain between the base XY plane and the borders of the plotted function. 

.TP
\fIclevel\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to the array that defines the contour level spacing. 
.TP
\fInlevel\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of elements in the clevel array.
