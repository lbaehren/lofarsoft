\fBplsdiori\fP - Set plot orientation 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsdiori\fP(\fIrot\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

Note, arbitrary rotation parameters such as 0.2 (corresponding to 18 degrees) are possible, but the usual values for the rotation parameter are 0., 1., 2., and 3. corresponding to 0 degrees (landscape mode), 90 degrees (portrait mode), 180 degrees (seascape mode), and 270 degrees (upside-down mode). If \fBplsdiori\fP(3plplot) is not called the default value of \fIrot\fP is 0.
