@section The PLplot Plotting Library

PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making
scientific plots from programs written in C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran95, Java, Octave, 
Perl, Python, and Tcl/Tk. The PLplot project is being developed by a world-wide 
team who interact via the facilities provided by SourceForge (@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot,http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot})

The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, shade (gray-scale and color)
plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same
or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in
each graph. Different line styles, widths and colors are supported. A
virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used. 
There is full unicode support in the PLplot library, and most of the
display drivers are capable of displaying any of the millions(?) of
characters in the unicode standard. Those driver that are not unicode
enabled can still display almost 1000 characters in the extended character set. 
This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of 
mathematical, musical, and other symbols. A variety of output devices and 
file formats are supported including a metafile format which can be 
subsequently rendered to any device/file. New devices and file formats can 
be easily added by writing a driver routine. For example, we have recently 
added a postscript driver with TrueType font support (PSTTF), a SVG file 
driver and a PDF file driver. A wxWidgets interactive driver is currently 
in development. 

PLplot was originally developed by Sze Tan of the University of
Auckland in Fortran-77. Many of the underlying concepts used in the
PLplot package are based on ideas used in Tim Pearson's PGPLOT
package. Sze Tan writes:

@quotation

I'm rather amazed how far PLPLOT has traveled given its origins
etc. I first used PGPLOT on the Starlink VAX computers while I was
a graduate student at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in
Cambridge from 1983-1987. At the beginning of 1986, I was to give a
seminar within the department at which I wanted to have a computer
graphics demonstration on an IBM PC which was connected to a
completely non-standard graphics card. Having about a week to do
this and not having any drivers for the card, I started from the
back end and designed PLPLOT to be such that one only needed to be
able to draw a line or a dot on the screen in order to do arbitrary
graphics. The application programmer's interface was made as
similar as possible to PGPLOT so that I could easily port my
programs from the VAX to the PC. The kernel of PLPLOT was modeled
on PGPLOT but the code is not derived from it.
@end quotation

The C version of PLplot was developed by Tony Richardson on a
Commodore Amiga. In the process, several of the routines were
rewritten to improve efficiency and some new features added. The
program structure was changed somewhat to make it easier to
incorporate new devices. Additional features were added to allow
three-dimensional plotting and better access to low-level routines.

PLplot 5.0 is a continuation of our work on PLplot 4.0, which never
got widely distributed. It became clear during the work on 4.0 that
in order to support an interactive driver under Unix (using Tcl/Tk),
many additions to the basic capabilities of the package were needed.
So without stopping to fully document and bug-fix the 4.0 additions,
work on 5.0 was begun. The result is that a very capable
PLplot-based widget for the Tk toolkit has been written. This widget
can manipulate the plot (zoom/pan, scale, orient, change colors), as
well dump it to any supported device. There are help menus and user
customization options. These are still in the process of being
documented.

Other changes include the introduction of a new color palette (cmap1)
for smooth color shaded images (typically for 2d or 3d plots --
in which color represents function intensity), support for color fill
plots, and lots more cool stuff. The manual has been rewritten in
LaTeXinfo, so that there is now a printed version and an online
(info) version of the document. The manual is still in a state of
flux and will be fleshed out in more detail in later updates.

Some of the improvements in PLplot 5.0 include: the addition of
several new routines to enhance usage from Fortran and design of a
portable C to Fortran interface. Additional support was added for
coordinate mappings in contour plots and some bugs fixed. New
labeling options were added. The font handling code was made more
flexible and portable. A portable PLplot metafile driver and
renderer was developed, allowing one to create a generic graphics
file and do the actual rendering later (even on a different
system). The ability to create family output files was added. The
internal code structure was dramatically reworked, with elimination
of global variables (for a more robust package), the drivers
rewritten to improve consistency, and the ability to maintain
multiple output streams added. An XFig driver was added. Other
contributions include Clair Nielsen's (LANL) X-window driver (very
nice for high-speed color graphics) and tektronix file viewer. At
present, Maurice LeBrun and Geoff Furnish are the active developers
and maintainers of PLplot.

We have attempted to keep PLplot 5.0 backward compatible with
previous versions of PLplot. However, some functions are now
obsolete, and many new ones have been added (e.g. new contouring
functions, variable get/set routines, functions that affect label
appearance). Codes written in C that use PLplot must be recompiled
including the new header file @file{plplot.h} before
linking to the new PLplot library.

PLplot is currently known to work on the following systems:
Unix/Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows XP. The Unix/Linux version is
the best supported of these possibilities.
The PLplot package is freely
distributable, but @i{not} in the public domain.
See @ref{Copyrights,,Copyrights}. for distribution criteria.

We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in
the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes. If PLplot
is used in any published papers, please include an acknowledgment
or citation of our work, which will help us to continue improving
PLplot. Please direct all communication to the general PLplot
mailing list, plplot-general@@lists.sourceforge.net.

@node Getting a Copy of the PLplot Package, Installing and Using the PLplot Library, The PLplot Plotting Library, Introduction
@section Getting a Copy of the PLplot Package

At present, the only mechanism we are providing for distribution of
the PLplot is by electronic transmission over the Internet. We
encourage others to make it available to users without Internet
access. PLplot is a SourceForge project and may be obtained by
the usual SourceForge file release and anonymous cvs access that is made
available from links at
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot,http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot}.

@node Installing and Using the PLplot Library, Organization of this Manual, Getting a Copy of the PLplot Package, Introduction
@section Installing and Using the PLplot Library

The installation procedure is by necessity system specific;
installation notes for each system are provided in
@ref{Notes for each Operating System that We Support,,Notes for each Operating System that We Support}..
The procedure requires that all of the routines be
compiled and they are then usually placed in a linkable
library.

After the library has been created, you can write your main program
to make the desired PLplot calls. Example programs in C, C++,
Fortran77, Fortran95 and Java are included as a guide.
Plots generated from the example programs are shown
@uref{http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html,here}.

You will then need to compile your program and link it with the
PLplot library(s). See
@ref{Notes for each Operating System that We Support,,Notes for each Operating System that We Support}. for more details).

You can also use Tcl/Tk, Perl and Python scripts to generate plots
using the PLplot libraries. Examples of these possibilities are
also included as a guide.

@node Organization of this Manual, Copyrights, Installing and Using the PLplot Library, Introduction
@section Organization of this Manual

The PLplot library has been designed so that it is easy to write
programs producing graphical output without having to set up large
numbers of parameters. However, more precise control of the results
may be necessary, and these are accommodated by providing lower-level
routines which change the system defaults. The manual first describes
the overall process of producing a graph using the high-level
routines (see @ref{Plotting a Simple Graph,,Plotting a Simple Graph}.). For a discussion of
the underlying concepts of the plotting process and an introduction
to some of the more complex routines (see @ref{Advanced Use of PLplot,,Advanced Use of PLplot}.).
An alphabetical list of the user-accessible PLplot functions with
detailed descriptions is given in the reference section of the manual
(see @ref{The Common API for PLplot,,The Common API for PLplot}.).

Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used
in the description of each PLplot function. If you have difficulty
interpreting the call syntax as described in this manual, please refer
to part III, Language Bindings. This manual includes:
C (@ref{C Language,,C Language}.), 
C++ (@ref{A C++ Interface for PLplot,,A C++ Interface for PLplot}.), 
Fortran 95 (@ref{Fortran 95 Language,,Fortran 95 Language}.), 
Fortran 77 (@ref{Fortran 77 Language,,Fortran 77 Language}.),
Java (???),
Tcl (@ref{Using PLplot from Tcl,,Using PLplot from Tcl}.),
Perl (@ref{Using PLplot from Perl,,Using PLplot from Perl}.) and
Python (@ref{Using PLplot from Python,,Using PLplot from Python}.). Since PLplot has a long
history, bindings to your language of choice are probably available
though not necessarily in the PLplot distribution. It is a good idea
to ask around and do a quick search before rolling your own.

The meaning of the function (subroutine)
arguments is typically the same regardless of what language you are
using to call PLplot (but there are some exceptions to this). The
arguments for each function are usually specified in terms of PLBOOL,
PLINT,and PLFLT---these are the internal PLplot representations for
logical, integer, and floating point, and are typically a zero (false) or
non-zero (true) contained in a long, a long, and a float (or
a LOGICAL, INTEGER, and a REAL, for Fortran programmers). See
@ref{C Language,,C Language}. for more detail.

Most of the output devices supported by PLplot are listed in
@ref{The PLplot Display Driver Family,,The PLplot Display Driver Family}. and @ref{The PLplot Output Driver Family,,The PLplot Output Driver Family}., 
along with description of the device driver--PLplot interface, 
metafile output, family files, and vt100/tek4010 emulators.

@node Plotting a Simple Graph, Initializing PLplot, , Simple Use of PLplot
@section Plotting a Simple Graph

We shall first consider plotting simple graphs showing the dependence
of one variable upon another. Such a graph may be composed of
several elements:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
A box which defines the ranges of the variables, perhaps with
axes and numeric labels along its edges.

@item
A set of points or lines within the box showing the functional
dependence.

@item
A set of labels for the variables and a title for the graph.
@end itemize

In order to draw such a graph, it is necessary to call at least four
of the PLplot functions:

@enumerate 

@item
@code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}), to initialize PLplot.

@item
@code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}), to define the range and scale of the
graph, and draw labels, axes, etc.

@item
One or more calls to @code{plline} (@pxref{plline; Draw a line}) or @code{plpoin} (@pxref{plpoin; Plots a character at the specified points}) to draw lines or points
as needed. Other more complex routines include @code{plbin} (@pxref{plbin; Plot a histogram from binned data}) and
@code{plhist} (@pxref{plhist; Plot a histogram from unbinned data}) to draw histograms, @code{plerrx} (@pxref{plerrx; Draw x error bar}) and @code{plerry} (@pxref{plerry; Draw y error bar}) to draw
error-bars.

@item
@code{plend} (@pxref{plend; End plotting session}), to close the plot.
@end enumerate

More than one graph can be drawn on a single set of axes by making
repeated calls to the routines listed in item 3 above. PLplot only
needs to be initialized once unless plotting to multiple output
devices.

@node Initializing PLplot, Defining Plot Scales and Axes, Plotting a Simple Graph, Simple Use of PLplot
@section Initializing PLplot

Before any actual plotting calls are made, a graphics program must
call @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}), is the main initialization routine for PLplot. It
sets up all internal data structures necessary for plotting and
initializes the output device driver. If the output device has not
already been specified when @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) is called, a list of valid
output devices is given and the user is prompted for a choice.
Either the device number or a device keyword is accepted.

There are several routines affecting the initialization that must
be called @i{before} @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}), if they are used. The
function @code{plsdev} (@pxref{plsdev; Set the device [keyword] name}) allows you to set the device explicitly. The
function @code{plsetopt} (@pxref{plsetopt; Set any command-line option}) allows you to set any command-line option
internally in your code. The function @code{plssub} (@pxref{plssub; Set the number of subpages in x and y}) may be called to
divide the output device plotting area into several subpages of equal
size, each of which can be used separately. 

One advances to the next page (or screen) via @code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}). If subpages
are used, this can be used to advance to the next subpage or to a
particular subpage.

@node Defining Plot Scales and Axes, Labeling the Graph, Initializing PLplot, Simple Use of PLplot
@section Defining Plot Scales and Axes

The function @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) is used to define the scales and axes for simple
graphs. @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) starts a new picture on the next subpage (or a new
page if necessary), and defines the ranges of the variables required.
The routine will also draw a box, axes, and numeric labels if
requested. The syntax for @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) is:


@quotation

@t{
@b{plenv}
(@i{xmin}, @i{xmax}, @i{ymin}, @i{ymax}, @i{just}, @i{axis});}
@end quotation

@table @asis

@item   @code{xmin, xmax}  (@samp{PLFLT}, input)  
The left and right limits for the horizontal axis.

@item   @code{ymin, ymax}  (@samp{PLFLT}, input)  
The bottom and top limits for the vertical axis.

@item   @code{just}  (@samp{PLINT}, input)  
This should be zero or one. If @code{just} is
one, the scales of the x-axis and y-axis will be the same (in
units per millimeter); otherwise the axes are scaled
independently. This parameter is useful for ensuring that
objects such as circles have the correct aspect ratio in the
final plot.

@item   @code{axis}  (@samp{PLINT}, input)  
@code{axis} controls whether a box, tick marks,
labels, axes, and/or a grid are drawn.

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@code{axis} = -2: No box or annotation.

@item
@code{axis} = -1: Draw box only.

@item
@code{axis} = 0: Draw box, labeled with
coordinate values around edge.

@item
@code{axis} = 1: In addition to box and labels,
draw the two axes X = 0 and Y = 0.

@item
@code{axis} = 2: Same as
@code{axis} = 1, but also draw a grid at the
major tick interval.

@item
@code{axis} = 10: Logarithmic X axis, linear Y
axis.

@item
@code{axis} = 11: Logarithmic X axis, linear Y
axis and draw line Y = 0.

@item
@code{axis} = 20: Linear X axis,
logarithmic Y axis.

@item
@code{axis} = 21: Linear X axis, logarithmic Y
axis and draw line X = 0.

@item
@code{axis} = 30: Logarithmic X and Y axes.
@end itemize
@end table

Note: Logarithmic axes only affect the appearance of the axes and
their labels, so it is up to the user to compute the logarithms prior
to passing them to @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) and any of the other routines. Thus, if a
graph has a 3-cycle logarithmic axis from 1 to 1000, we need to set
@code{xmin} =
@code{log_10}(1) = 0.0, and
@code{xmax} =
@code{log_10}(1000) = 3.0.

For greater control over the size of the plots, axis labeling and
tick intervals, more complex graphs should make use of the functions
@code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates}), @code{plvasp} (@pxref{plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only}), @code{plvpas} (@pxref{plvpas; Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio}), @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}), @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}), and routines for
manipulating axis labeling @code{plgxax} (@pxref{plgxax; Get x axis parameters}) through @code{plszax} (@pxref{plszax; Set z axis parameters}).

@section Labeling the Graph

The function @code{pllab} (@pxref{pllab; Simple routine to write labels}) may be called after @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) to write labels on
the x and y axes, and at the top of the picture. All the variables
are character variables or constants. Trailing spaces are removed
and the label is centered in the appropriate field. The syntax for
@code{pllab} (@pxref{pllab; Simple routine to write labels}) is:

PLplot can draw graphs consisting of points with optional error bars,
line segments or histograms. Functions which perform each of these
actions may be called after setting up the plotting environment using
@code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}). All of the following functions draw within the box defined
by @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}), and any lines crossing the boundary are clipped.
Functions are also provided for drawing surface and contour
representations of multi-dimensional functions. See @ref{Advanced Use of PLplot,,Advanced Use of PLplot}. for discussion of finer control of plot

command line arguments recognized by PLplot are given by the -h
option:


@example

@end example

The command-line options can also be set using the @code{plsetopt} (@pxref{plsetopt; Set any command-line option}) function, if invoked before @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}).

Some options are may not be recognized by individual drivers. If an option is not recognized but should be, please contact the driver author via the plplot mailing lists.

Many drivers have specific options that can be set using the -drvopt command line option or with @code{plsetopt} (@pxref{plsetopt; Set any command-line option}). These options are documented in @ref{The PLplot Display Driver Family,,The PLplot Display Driver Family}. and @ref{The PLplot Output Driver Family,,The PLplot Output Driver Family}..

@node Output Devices, Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers, Command Line Arguments, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Output Devices

PLplot supports a variety of output devices, via a set of device drivers.
Each driver is required to emulate a small set of low-level graphics
primitives such as initialization, line draw and page advance, as well
as be completely independent of the PLplot package as a whole. Thus a
driver may be very simple, as in the case of the many black and white file
drivers (tektronix, etc.). More complicated and/or color systems require a
bit more effort by the driver, with the most effort required by an output
device with a graphical user interface, including menus for screen dumps,
palette manipulation, and so forth. At present only the tk driver does
the latter on Unix systems. At present we aren't pursuing
a Macintosh development effort due to a lack of time and expertise, but
will assist anyone wanting to volunteer for the job.

Note that if you always render to a PLplot metafile, you can always
@code{plrender} them to new devices as they become available.

The list of available devices presented when starting PLplot (via
@samp{plstar}) is determined at compile time. When installing PLplot you may wish
to exclude devices not available on your system in order to reduce screen
clutter. To include a specified device, simply define the appropriate macro
constant when building PLplot (see the installation instructions for your
system).

The device drivers for PLplot terminal output at present are given in 
@ref{PLplot Terminal Output Devices,,PLplot Terminal Output Devices}. while 
drivers for file output are given in
@ref{PLplot File Output Devices,,PLplot File Output Devices}..
The driver for OS/2 PM is available separately. See the section on OS/2 in
the Appendix for more details.

@subsection Driver Functions

A dispatch table is used to direct function calls to whatever driver
is chosen at run-time. Below are listed the names of each entry in the
PLDispatchTable dispatch table struct defined in
@file{plcore.h}. The entries specific to each device (defined
in @file{drivers/*.c}) are typically named similarly but with
pl_ replaced by a string specific for that device (the
logical order must be preserved, however). The dispatch table entries are :

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@samp{pl_MenuStr}: Pointer to string that is printed in device menu.

@item
@samp{pl_DevName}: A short device "name" for device selection by name.

@item
@samp{pl_type}: 0 for file-oriented device, 1 for interactive
(the null driver uses -1 here).

@item
@samp{pl_init}: Initialize device. This routine may also prompt the user
for certain device parameters or open a graphics file
(see Notes). Called only once to set things up. Certain
options such as familying and resolution (dots/mm) should
be set up before calling this routine (note: some drivers
ignore these).

@item
@samp{pl_line}: Draws a line between two points.

@item
@samp{pl_polyline}: Draws a polyline (no broken segments).

@item
@samp{pl_eop}: Finishes out current page (see Notes).

@item
@samp{pl_bop}: Set up for plotting on a new page. May also open a new
a new graphics file (see Notes).

@item
@samp{pl_tidy}: Tidy up. May close graphics file (see Notes).

@item
@samp{pl_state}: Handle change in PLStream state
(color, pen width, fill attribute, etc).

@item
@samp{pl_esc}: Escape function for driver-specific commands.
@end itemize

@noindent
Notes: Most devices allow multi-page plots to be stored in a single graphics
file, in which case the graphics file should be opened in the pl_init()
routine, closed in pl_tidy(), and page advances done by calling pl_eop and
pl_bop() in sequence. If multi-page plots need to be stored in different
files then pl_bop() should open the file and pl_eop() should close it. Do
NOT open files in both pl_init() and pl_bop() or close files in both
pl_eop() and pl_tidy(). It is recommended that when adding new functions to
only a certain driver, the escape function be used. Otherwise it is
necessary to add a null routine to all the other drivers to handle the new
function. 

@node PLplot Metafiles and Plrender, Family File Output, Driver Functions, Output Devices
@subsection PLplot Metafiles and Plrender

The PLplot metafile is a way to store and transport your graphical data for
rendering at a later time or on a different system. A PLplot metafile is
in binary format in order to speed access and keep storage costs
reasonable. All data is stored in device-independent format (written as a
stream of bytes); the resulting file is about as portable as a tektronix
vector graphics file and only slightly larger. 

Each PLplot metafile begins with a header string that identifies it as
such, as well as the version number of the format since
this may change in time. The utility for rendering the metafile,
@code{plrender}, verifies that the input file is indeed a valid PLplot metafile,
and that it understands the format the metafile is written in.
@code{plrender} is part of the PLplot package and should be built at the time of
building PLplot, and then put into your search path. It is capable of 
high speed rendering of the graphics file, especially if the output device
can accept commands at a high rate (e.g. X windows). 

The commands as written by the metafile driver at present are as follows:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@samp{INITIALIZE}

@item
@samp{CLOSE}

@item
@samp{SWITCH_TO_TEXT}

@item

Each command is written as a single byte, possibly followed by
additional data bytes. The @samp{NEW_COLOR} and
@samp{NEW_WIDTH} commands each write 2 data bytes, the
@samp{LINETO} command writes 4 data bytes, and the
@samp{LINE} command writes 8 data bytes. The most common
instruction in the typical metafile will be the @samp{LINETO}
command, which draws a continuation of the previous line to the given point.
This data encoding is not quite as efficient as the tektronix format, which
uses 4 bytes instead of 5 here (1 command @samp{+} 4 data),
however the PLplot encoding is far simpler to implement and more robust. The
@samp{ESCAPE} function writes a second command character
(opcode) followed by an arbitrary number of data bytes depending on the
value of the opcode. Note that any data written must be in device
independent form to maintain the transportability of the metafile so
floating point numbers are not allowed. 

The short usage message for @code{plrender} is printed if one inputs
insufficient or invalid arguments, and is as follows:

The options are generally self explanatory (family files are explained in
@ref{Family File Output,,Family File Output}.).
Most of these options have default values, and for those that don't
@code{plrender} will prompt the user. The
@samp{-px} and @samp{-py} options are
not so useful at present, because everything is scaled down by the
specified factor --- resulting in labels that are too small (future
versions of @code{plrender} might allow changing the label size as well). 

Additional options may be added in future releases.

@node Family File Output, Interactive Output Devices, PLplot Metafiles and Plrender, Output Devices
@subsection Family File Output

When sending PLplot to a file, the user has the option of generating a
family of output files for most output file drivers.
This can be valuable when generating a large amount of output, so as to not
strain network or printer facilities by processing extremely large single
files. Each family member file can be treated as a completely independent
file. In addition, @code{plrender} has the ability to process a set of
family member files as a single logical file.

To create a family file, one must simply call @code{plsfam} (@pxref{plsfam; Set family file parameters}) with the
familying flag @samp{fam} set to 1, and the desired maximum
member size (in bytes) in @samp{bmax}. @code{plsfam} (@pxref{plsfam; Set family file parameters}) also allows
you to set the current family file number. If the current output
driver does not support familying, there will be no effect. This call must
be made @i{before} calling @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization}). 

If familying is enabled, the name given for the output file (on the
command line, in response to the @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) prompt, as a @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization}) argument,
or as the result of a call to @code{plsfnam} (@pxref{plsfnam; Set output file name})) becomes the name template for the
family. Thus, if you request a plmeta output file with name
@file{test-%n.plm}, the files actually created will be
@file{test-1.plm}, @file{test-2.plm}, and so on,
where @file{%n} indicates where the member number is replaced.
If there is no @file{%n}, then the output file becomes the
stem name and the created files will be like
@file{test.plm.1}, @file{test.plm.2}, and so on.
A new file is automatically started once the byte limit for the current file
is passed, but not until the next page break. One may insure a new file at
every page break by making the byte limit small enough. Alternatively, if
the byte limit is large you can still insure a new file is automatically
started after a page break if you precede the call to @code{pleop} (@pxref{pleop; Eject current page}) with a call to
@code{plfamadv} (@pxref{plfamadv; Advance to the next family file on the next new page}).

The @code{plgfam} (@pxref{plgfam; Get family file parameters}) routine can be used from within the user program to find
out more about the graphics file being written. In particular, by
periodically checking the number of the member file currently being written
to, one can detect when a new member file is started. This information
might be used in various ways; for example you could spawn a process to
automatically plrender each metafile after it is closed (perhaps during a
long simulation run) and send it off to be printed. 

@code{plrender} has several options for dealing with
family files. It can process a single member file
(@code{plrender} @file{test.plm.1})
or the entire family if given only the stem name
(@code{plrender} @file{test.plm})
It can also create family files on output, rendering to any
device that supports familying, including another metafile if desired. The
size of member files in this case is input through the argument list, and
defaults to 1MB if unspecified (this may be changed during the PLplot
installation, however). @code{plrender} can also create a
single output file from a familied input metafile. 

@node Interactive Output Devices, Specifying the Output Device, Family File Output, Output Devices
@subsection Interactive Output Devices

Here we shall discuss briefly some of the more common interactive output
devices. 

Many popular terminals or terminal emulators at present have a
facility for switching between text and graphics screens.
This includes the xterm emulator under X-windows, vt100's with
Retrographics, and numerous emulators for microcomputers which have a dual
vt100/tek4010 emulation capability. On these devices, it is possible to
switch between the text and graphics screens by surrounding your PLplot
calls by calls to @code{plgra} (@pxref{plgra; Switch to graphics screen}) and @code{pltext} (@pxref{pltext; Switch to text screen}). This will allow your diagnostic and
informational code output to not interfere with your graphical output.

At present, only the xterm driver supports switching between text
and graphics screens. The escape sequences as sent by the xterm driver
are fairly standard, however, and have worked correctly on most other
popular vt100/tek4010 emulators we've tried.

When using the xterm driver, hitting a RETURN will advance and clear the
page. If indeed running from an xterm, you may resize, move, cover and
uncover the window. The behavior of the X-window driver is quite different,
however. First, it is much faster, as there is no tty-like handshaking
going on. Second, a mouse click is used to advance and clear the page,
rather than a RETURN.

On a tektronix 4014 compatible device, you may preview tektronix output
files via the @code{pltek} utility.
@code{pltek} will let you step through the file interactively,
skipping backward or forward if desired. The help message for
@code{pltek} is as follows:

@example

% pltek
Usage: pltek filename 
At the prompt, the following replies are recognized:
   h,?    Give this help message.
    q     Quit program.
   <n>    Go to the specified page number.
   -<n>   Go back <n> pages.
   +<n>   Go forward <n> pages.
 <Return> Go to the next page.

@end example

@noindent
The output device is switched to text mode before the prompt is given,
which causes the prompt to go to the vt102 window under xterm and
most vt100/tek4010 emulators.

@node Specifying the Output Device, , Interactive Output Devices, Output Devices
@subsection Specifying the Output Device

The main initialization routine for PLplot is @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}), which sets up
all internal data structures necessary for plotting and initializes
the output device driver. The output device can be a terminal, disk
file, window system, pipe, or socket. If the output device has not
already been specified when @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) is called, a list of valid
output devices is given and the user is prompted for a choice. For
example:


@example

% x01c
	
Plotting Options:
 < 1> xwin       X-Window (Xlib)
 < 2> tk         Tcl/TK Window
 < 3> xterm      Xterm Window

 <16> ljii       LaserJet II Bitmap File (150 dpi)
 <17> null       Null device

Enter device number or keyword: 
@end example

Either the device number or a device keyword is accepted. Specifying
the device by keyword is preferable in aliases or scripts since the
device number is dependent on the install procedure (the installer
can choose which device drivers to include). The device can be
specified prior to the call to @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) by:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
A call to @code{plsdev} (@pxref{plsdev; Set the device [keyword] name}).

@item
The @samp{-dev} @var{device}
command line argument, if the program's command line arguments
are being passed to the PLplot function
@code{plparseopts} (@pxref{plparseopts; Parse command-line arguments}).
@end itemize

Additional startup routines @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) and @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization}) are available but
these are simply front-ends to @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}), and should be avoided. It
is preferable to call @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) directly, along with the appropriate
setup calls, for the greater amount of control this provides (see the
example programs for more info).

Before @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) is called, you may modify the number of subpages the
output device is divided into via a call to
@code{plssub}. Subpages are useful for placing several
graphs on a page, but all subpages are constrained to be of the same
size. For greater flexibility, viewports can be used (see @ref{Defining the Viewport,,Defining the Viewport}. for more info on viewports). The routine
@code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}) is used to advance to a particular subpage or to the next
subpage. The screen is cleared (or a new piece of paper loaded) if a
new subpage is requested when there are no subpages left on the
current page. When a page is divided into subpages, the default
character, symbol and tick sizes are scaled inversely as the square
root of the number of subpages in the vertical direction. This is
designed to improve readability of plot labels as the plot size
shrinks.

PLplot has the ability to write to multiple output streams. An
output stream corresponds to a single logical device to which one
plots independent of all other streams. The function @code{plsstrm} (@pxref{plsstrm; Set current output stream}) is
used to switch between streams -- you may only write to one output
stream at a time. At present, an output stream is not limited by the
type of device, however, it may not be wise to attempt opening two
terminal devices. An example usage for the creation of multiple
streams is as follows:


@example
#include "plplot.h"

main()
@{
    int nx = 2, ny = 2;

    plssub(nx, ny);
    plsdev("xwin");
    plinit();

    plots for stream 0

    plsstrm(1);
    plssub(nx, ny);
    plsdev("plmeta");
    plsfnam("tst.plm");
    plinit();

    plots for stream 1

    plsstrm(0);

    plots for stream 0
@end example

and so on, for sending output simultaneously to an X-window and a
metafile. The default stream corresponds to stream number zero. At
present, the majority of output drivers can only be used by a single
stream (exceptions include the metafile driver and X-window driver).
Also see example program 14 (note: only the C version is available,
although it can be done equally well from Fortran).

At the end of a plotting program, it is important to close the
plotting device by calling @code{plend} (@pxref{plend; End plotting session}). This flushes any internal
buffers and frees any memory that may have been allocated, for all
open output streams. You may call @code{plend1} (@pxref{plend1; End plotting session for current stream}) to close the plotting
device for the current output stream only. Note that if PLplot is
initialized more than once during a program to change the output
device, an automatic call to @code{plend1} (@pxref{plend1; End plotting session for current stream}) is made before the new device
is opened for the given stream.

@node Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers, View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows, Output Devices, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers

Any bitmap driver in the PLplot family should be able to use fonts
(TrueType and others) that are rendered by the FreeType library just as long
as the device supports setting an individual pixel. Note that drivers
interact with FreeType using the support routines 
@samp{plD_FreeType_init},
@samp{plD_render_freetype_text},
@samp{plD_FreeType_Destroy},
@samp{pl_set_extended_cmap0}, and
@samp{pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer} that are coded in
@file{plfreetype.c}.

The use of these support routines is exemplified by the
@file{gd.c} driver. Here we make some notes to accompany
this driver which should make it easier to migrate other drivers to
use the FreeType library. Every code fragment we mention below should be surrounded
with a @samp{#ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE...#endif} to quarantine these
fragments for systems without the FreeType library. For interactive devices that
need caching of text drawing, reference should also be made to
@file{wingcc.c}.

@node Write a call back function to plot a single pixel, Initialise FreeType, , Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
@subsection Write a call back function to plot a single pixel

First, write a call back function, of type
@samp{plD_pixel_fp}, which specifies how a single pixel is set
in the current colour. This can be of type static void. For example, in the
@file{gd.c} driver it looks like this:

@example

void plD_pixel_gd (PLStream *pls, short x, short y)
@{
png_Dev *dev=(png_Dev *)pls->dev;

   gdImageSetPixel(dev->im_out, x, y,dev->colour);
@}
@end example

@node Initialise FreeType, Add A Command to redraw text [interactive drivers only], Write a call back function to plot a single pixel, Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
@subsection Initialise FreeType

Next, we have to initialise the FreeType library. For the
@file{gd.c} driver this is done via two separate functions due
to the order that dependent information is initialised in the driver.

The "level 1" initialisation of FreeType does two things: 1) calls
@samp{plD_FreeType_init(pls)}, which in turn allocates memory to
the pls->FT structure; and 2) stores the location of the call back routine.


@example

void init_freetype_lv1 (PLStream *pls)
@{
FT_Data *FT;

plD_FreeType_init(pls);

FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;
FT->pixel= (plD_pixel_fp)plD_pixel_gd;

@}
@end example

This initialisation routine is called at the end of 
@samp{plD_init_png_Dev(PLStream *pls)} in the
@file{gd.c} driver:


@example

if (freetype)
   @{
    pls->dev_text = 1; /* want to draw text */
    init_freetype_lv1(pls);
    FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;
    FT->smooth_text=smooth_text;
   @}
@end example

@samp{"freetype"} is a local variable which is parsed
through @samp{plParseDrvOpts} to determine if the user wanted
FreeType text. In that case @samp{pls->dev_text} is set to 1 to
indicate the driver will be rendering it's own text. After that, we always
use @samp{pls->dev_text} to work out if we want FreeType or
not.

Similarly, @samp{"smooth_text"} is a local variable passed
through @samp{plParseDrvOpts} to find out if the user wants
smoothing. Since there is nothing in PLStream to track smoothing, we have to
set the FT->smooth_text flag as well at this time.

The "level 2" initialisation function initialises everything else
required for using the FreeType library but has to be called after the
screen resolution and dpi have been set. Therefore, it is called at the end
of @samp{plD_init_png()}, where it looks like:

@example

if (pls->dev_text)
   @{
    init_freetype_lv2(pls);
   @}
@end example

The actual function looks like this:

@example

static void init_freetype_lv2 (PLStream *pls)
@{
png_Dev *dev=(png_Dev *)pls->dev;
FT_Data *FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;

FT->scale=dev->scale;
FT->ymax=dev->pngy;
FT->invert_y=1;

if (FT->smooth_text==1)
   @{
    FT->ncol0_org=pls->ncol0;                                   /* save a copy of the original size of ncol0 */
    FT->ncol0_xtra=NCOLOURS-(pls->ncol1+pls->ncol0);            /* work out how many free slots we have */
    FT->ncol0_width=FT->ncol0_xtra/(pls->ncol0-1);              /* find out how many different shades of anti-aliasing we can do */
    if (FT->ncol0_width>64) FT->ncol0_width=64;                 /* set a maximum number of shades */
    plscmap0n(FT->ncol0_org+(FT->ncol0_width*pls->ncol0));      /* redefine the size of cmap0 */
/* the level manipulations are to turn off the plP_state(PLSTATE_CMAP0)
 * call in plscmap0 which (a) leads to segfaults since the GD image is
 * not defined at this point and (b) would be inefficient in any case since
 * setcmap is always called later (see plD_bop_png) to update the driver
 * color palette to be consistent with cmap0. */
    @{
       PLINT level_save;
       level_save = pls->level;
       pls->level = 0;
       pl_set_extended_cmap0(pls, FT->ncol0_width, FT->ncol0_org); /* call the function to add the extra cmap0 entries and calculate stuff */
       pls->level = level_save;
    @}
   @}

@}
@end example

FT->scale is a scaling factor to convert coordinates. This is used by
the @file{gd.c} and some other drivers to scale back a larger virtual page and this
eliminate the "hidden line removal bug". Set it to 1 if your device driver
doesn't use any scaling.

Some coordinate systems have zero on the bottom, others have zero on
the top. FreeType does it one way, and most everything else does it the
other. To make sure everything is working ok, we have to "flip" the
coordinates, and to do this we need to know how big in the Y dimension the
page is, and whether we have to invert the page or leave it alone.


@itemize @bullet{}

@item
FT->ymax specifies the size of the page

@item
FT->invert_y=1 tells us to invert the
y-coordinates, FT->invert_y=0 will not invert the coordinates.
@end itemize

We also do some computational gymnastics to "expand" cmap0 if the user
wants anti-aliased text. Basically, you have to work out how many spare
colours there are in the driver after cmap0 and cmap1 are done, then set a
few variables in FT to let the render know how many colours it's going to
have at its disposal, and call plscmap0n to resize cmap0. The call to
@samp{pl_set_extended_cmap0} does the remaining part of the
work. Note it essential to protect that call by the
@samp{pls->level} manipulations for the reasons stated. 

@node Add A Command to redraw text [interactive drivers only], Add Function Prototypes, Initialise FreeType, Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
@subsection Add A Command to redraw text (interactive drivers only)

Plplot only caches drawing commands, not text plotting commands, so
for interactive devices which refresh their display by replaying the plot
buffer, a separate function has to be called to redraw the text. plfreetype
knows when buffering is being used by a device driver, and will automatically
start caching text when necessary. To redraw this cached text, a call to
@samp{pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer} has to be added after the driver has called
@samp{plRemakePlot}. The following example is from @file{wingcc.c}.

@example

                if (dev->waiting==1)
                @{
                    plRemakePlot(pls);
                    #ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE
                    pl_RemakeFreeType_text_from_buffer(pls);
                    #endif
                 @}
@end example

@node Add Function Prototypes, Add Closing functions, Add A Command to redraw text [interactive drivers only], Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
@subsection Add Function Prototypes

Next, to the top of the drivers' source file add the prototype
definitions for the functions just written.

@example

static void plD_pixel_gd (PLStream *pls, short x, short y);
static void init_freetype_lv1 (PLStream *pls);
static void init_freetype_lv2 (PLStream *pls);
@end example

@node Add Closing functions, , Add Function Prototypes, Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers
@subsection Add Closing functions

Finally, add a @samp{plD_FreeType_Destroy(pls)} entry to
the device "tidy" function; this command deallocates memory allocated to the
FT entry in the stream, closes the FreeType library and any open fonts. It
is also a good idea to reset CMAP0 back to it's original size here if
anti-aliasing was done. For example, in the @file{gd.c}
driver, it looks like this:

@example

void plD_tidy_png(PLStream *pls)
@{
   fclose(pls->OutFile);

#ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE
   FT_Data *FT=(FT_Data *)pls->FT;
   plscmap0n(FT->ncol0_org);

   plD_FreeType_Destroy(pls);
#endif

   free_mem(pls->dev);

@section View Surfaces, (Sub-)Pages, Viewports and Windows

There is a whole hierarchy of coordinate systems associated with
any PLplot graph. At the lowest level a device provides a view surface
(coordinates in mm's) which can be a terminal screen or a sheet of paper
in the output device. @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) or @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) (or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization})) makes that
device view surface accessible as a page or divided up into sub-pages
(see @code{plssub} (@pxref{plssub; Set the number of subpages in x and y})) which are accessed with @code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}). Before a graph can be
drawn for a subpage, the program must call appropriate routines in
PLplot to define the viewport for the subpage and a window for the
viewport. A viewport is a rectangular region of the
@i{subpage} which is specified in normalized subpage
coordinates or millimetres. A window is a rectangular region of
world-coordinate space which is mapped directly to its viewport. (When
drawing a graph, the programmer usually wishes to specify the
coordinates of the points to be plotted in terms of the values of the
variables involved. These coordinates are called @i{world
coordinates}, and may have any floating-point value
representable by the computer.)

Although the usual choice is to have one viewport per subpage, and
one window per viewport, each subpage can have more than one (possibly
overlapping) viewport defined, and each viewport can have more than one
window (more than one set of world coordinates) defined.

@node Defining the Viewport, Defining the Window, , View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows
@subsection Defining the Viewport

After defining the view surface and subpage with the appropriate
call to @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) or @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) (or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization})) and a call to @code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}) it
is necessary to define the portion of this subpage which is to be used
for plotting the graph (the viewport). All lines and symbols (except
for labels drawn by @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}), @code{plmtex} (@pxref{plmtex; Write text relative to viewport boundaries}) and @code{pllab} (@pxref{pllab; Simple routine to write labels})) are clipped at the
viewport boundaries. 

Viewports are created within the current subpage. If the
division of the output device into equally sized subpages is
inappropriate, it is best to specify only a single subpage which
occupies the entire output device (by using @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) or by setting
@samp{nx = 1} and @samp{ny = 1} in @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization})
or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization})), and use one of the viewport specification subroutines
below to place the plot in the desired position on the page. 

There are four methods for specifying the viewport size, using the
subroutines @code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates}), @code{plsvpa} (@pxref{plsvpa; Specify viewport in absolute coordinates}), @code{plvasp} (@pxref{plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only}), and @code{plvpas} (@pxref{plvpas; Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio}) which are
called like this:


@example
    plvpor(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
    plsvpa(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
    plvasp(aspect);
    plvpas(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, aspect);
@end example

where in the case of @code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates}) and @code{plvpas} (@pxref{plvpas; Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio}), the arguments are given
in @i{normalized subpage coordinates} which are
defined to run from 0.0 to 1.0 along each edge of the subpage. Thus
for example,


@example
    plvpor(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
@end example

uses the top left quarter of the current subpage.

In order to get a graph of known physical size, the routine @code{plsvpa} (@pxref{plsvpa; Specify viewport in absolute coordinates})
defines the viewport in terms of absolute coordinates (millimeters)
measured from the bottom left-hand corner of the current subpage.
This routine should only be used when the size of the view surface is
known, and a definite scaling is required.

The routine @code{plvasp} (@pxref{plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only}) gives the largest viewport with the given aspect
ratio that fits in the current subpage (i.e. the ratio of the length
of the y axis to that of the x axis is equal to
@samp{aspect}). It also allocates space on the left and
top of the viewport for labels.

The routine @code{plvpas} (@pxref{plvpas; Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio}) gives the largest viewport with the given aspect
ratio that fits in the specified region (specified with normalized
subpage coordinates, as with @code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates})). This routine is functionally
equivalent to @code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates}) when a natural aspect ratio is
chosen (done by setting @samp{aspect} to 0.0). Unlike
@code{plvasp} (@pxref{plvasp; Specify viewport using aspect ratio only}), this routine reserves no extra space at the edges for
labels.

To help the user call @code{plsvpa} (@pxref{plsvpa; Specify viewport in absolute coordinates}) correctly, the routine @code{plgspa} (@pxref{plgspa; Get current subpage parameters}) is
provided which returns the positions of the extremities of the
current subpage measured in millimeters from the bottom left-hand
corner of the device. Thus, if to set up a viewport with a 10.0 mm
margin around it within the current subpage, the following sequence
of calls may be used:


@example
    plgspa(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
    plsvpa(10.0, xmax-xmin-10.0, 10.0, ymax-ymin-10.0);
@end example

A further routine @code{plvsta} (@pxref{plvsta; Select standard viewport}) is available which sets up a standard
viewport within the current subpage with suitable margins on each
side of the viewport. This may be used for simple graphs, as it
leaves enough room for axis labels and a title. This standard
viewport is that used by @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) (See @ref{Setting up a Standard Window,,Setting up a Standard Window}.).

Another way to get a specified aspect ratio is via the routine
@code{plsasp} [not!.. fix this], which sets the global
aspect ratio and must be called prior to @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}). An aspect ratio
of 0.0 corresponds to natural dimensions (i.e. fill
the page); any positive value will give the specified aspect ratio.
This scaling of plots is actually done in the driver, and so may not
work for all output devices (note that @code{plrender}
is capable of scaled aspect ratio plots to any device whether that
device supports scaling or not). In such scaled plots, absolute
plotting is done in the scaled coordinate system.

@node Defining the Window, Annotating the Viewport, Defining the Viewport, View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows
@subsection Defining the Window

The window must be defined after the viewport in order to map the
world coordinate rectangle into the viewport rectangle. The routine
@code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}) is used to specify the rectangle in world-coordinate space.
For example, if we wish to plot a graph showing the collector current
I_C as a function of the collector to emitter
voltage V_CE for a transistor where 0 <=
I_C <= 10.0 mA and 0 <=
V_CE <= 12.0 V, we would call the
function @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}) as follows:


@example
    plwind(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0);
@end example

Note that each of the arguments is a floating point number, and so
the decimal points are required. If the order of either the X limits
or Y limits is reversed, the corresponding axis will point in the
opposite sense, (i.e., right to left for X and top to bottom for Y).
The window must be defined before any calls to the routines which
actually draw the data points. Note however that @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}) may also
be called to change the window at any time. This will affect the
appearance of objects drawn later in the program, and is useful for
drawing two or more graphs with different axes on the same piece of
paper.

@node Annotating the Viewport, Setting up a Standard Window, Defining the Window, View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows
@subsection Annotating the Viewport

The routine @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}) is used to specify whether a frame is drawn
around the viewport and to control the positions of the axis
subdivisions and numeric labels. For our simple graph of the
transistor characteristics, we may wish to draw a frame consisting of
lines on all four sides of the viewport, and to place numeric labels
along the bottom and left hand side. We can also tell PLplot to
choose a suitable tick interval and the number of subticks between
the major divisions based upon the data range specified to @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}).
This is done using the following statement


@example
    plbox("bcnst", 0.0, 0, "bcnstv", 0.0, 0);
@end example

The lengths of major and minor ticks on the axes are set up by the
routines @code{plsmaj} (@pxref{plsmaj; Set length of major ticks}) and @code{plsmin} (@pxref{plsmin; Set length of minor ticks}).

Another routine @code{pllab} (@pxref{pllab; Simple routine to write labels}) provides for text labels for the bottom, left
hand side and top of the viewport. These labels are not clipped,
even though they lie outside the viewport (but they are clipped at
the subpage boundaries). @code{pllab} (@pxref{pllab; Simple routine to write labels}) actually calls the more general
routine @code{plmtex} (@pxref{plmtex; Write text relative to viewport boundaries}) which can be used for plotting labels at any point
relative to the viewport. For our example, we may use


@example
    pllab("V#dCE#u (Volts)", "I#dC#u (mA)", "TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS");
@end example

Note that @samp{#d} and @samp{#u} are escape
sequences (see @ref{Escape sequences in text,,Escape sequences in text}.) which allow
subscripts and superscripts to be used in text. They are described
more fully later in this chapter.

The appearance of axis labels may be further altered by auxiliary
calls to @code{plprec} (@pxref{plprec; Set precision in numeric labels}), @code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size}), @code{plsxax} (@pxref{plsxax; Set x axis parameters}), @code{plsyax} (@pxref{plsyax; Set y axis parameters}), and @code{plszax} (@pxref{plszax; Set z axis parameters}). The
routine @code{plprec} (@pxref{plprec; Set precision in numeric labels}) is used to set the number of decimal places
precision for axis labels, while @code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size}) modifies the heights of
characters used for the axis and graph labels. Routines @code{plsxax} (@pxref{plsxax; Set x axis parameters}),
@code{plsyax} (@pxref{plsyax; Set y axis parameters}), and @code{plszax} (@pxref{plszax; Set z axis parameters}) are used to modify the
@samp{digmax} setting for each axis, which affects how
floating point labels are formatted.

The @samp{digmax} variable represents the maximum field
width for the numeric labels on an axis (ignored if less than one).
If the numeric labels as generated by PLplot exceed this width, then
PLplot automatically switches to floating point representation. In
this case the exponent will be placed at the top left for a vertical
axis on the left, top right for a vertical axis on the right, and
bottom right for a horizontal axis.

For example, let's suppose that we have set @samp{digmax =
5} via @code{plsyax} (@pxref{plsyax; Set y axis parameters}), and for our plot a label is generated at
@samp{y = 0.0000478}. In this case the actual field
width is longer than @samp{digmax}, so PLplot switches to
floating point. In this representation, the label is printed as
simply 4.78 with the 10^-5 exponent placed
separately.

The determination of maximum length (i.e. @samp{digmax})
for fixed point quantities is complicated by the fact that long fixed
point representations look much worse than the same sized floating
point representation. Further, a fixed point number with magnitude
much less than one will actually gain in precision when written as
floating point. There is some compensation for this effect built
into PLplot, thus the internal representation for number of digits
kept (@samp{digfix}) may not always match the user's
specification (via @samp{digmax}). However, it will
always be true that @samp{digfix <= digmax}. The
PLplot defaults are set up such that good results are usually
obtained without user intervention.

Finally, after the call to @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}), the user may call routines
@code{plgxax} (@pxref{plgxax; Get x axis parameters}), @code{plgyax} (@pxref{plgyax; Get y axis parameters}), or @code{plgzax} (@pxref{plgzax; Get z axis parameters}) to obtain information about the
window just drawn. This can be helpful when deciding where to put
captions. For example, a typical usage would be to call @code{plgyax} (@pxref{plgyax; Get y axis parameters}) to
get the value of @samp{digits}, then offset the y axis
caption by that amount (plus a bit more) so that the caption
floats just to the outside of the numeric labels.
Note that the @samp{digits} value for each axis for the
current plot is not correct until @i{after} the call
to @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}) is complete.

@node Setting up a Standard Window, , Annotating the Viewport, View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows
@subsection Setting up a Standard Window

Having to call @code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}), @code{plvpor} (@pxref{plvpor; Specify viewport using coordinates}), @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}) and @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}) is excessively
cumbersome for drawing simple graphs. Subroutine @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) combines
all four of these in one subroutine, using the standard viewport, and
a limited subset of the capabilities of @code{plbox} (@pxref{plbox; Draw a box with axes; etc}). For example, the
graph described above could be initiated by the call:


@example
    plenv(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0, 0, 0);
@end example

which is equivalent to the following series of calls:


@example
    pladv(0);
    plvsta();
    plwind(0.0, 12.0, 0.0, 10.0);
    plbox("bcnst", 0.0, 0, "bcnstv", 0.0, 0);
@end example

@node Setting Line Attributes, Setting the Area Fill Pattern, View Surfaces; [Sub-]Pages; Viewports and Windows, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Setting Line Attributes

The graph drawing routines may be freely mixed with those described
in this section, allowing the user to control line color, width and
styles. The attributes set up by these routines apply modally, i.e,
all subsequent objects (lines, characters and symbols) plotted until
the next change in attributes are affected in the same way. The only
exception to this rule is that characters and symbols are not
affected by a change in the line style, but are always drawn using a
continuous line.

Line color is set using the routine @code{plcol0} (@pxref{plcol0; Set color; map0}). The argument is ignored
for devices which can only plot in one color, although some terminals
support line erasure by plotting in color zero.

Line width is set using @code{plwid} (@pxref{plwid; Set pen width}). This option is not supported by
all devices.

Line style is set using the routine @code{plstyl} (@pxref{plstyl; Set line style}) or @code{pllsty} (@pxref{pllsty; Select line style}). A broken
line is specified in terms of a repeated pattern consisting of marks
(pen down) and spaces (pen up). The arguments to this routine are
the number of elements in the line, followed by two pointers to
integer arrays specifying the mark and space lengths in micrometers.
Thus a line consisting of long and short dashes of lengths 4 mm
and 2 mm, separated by spaces of length 1.5 mm is specified
by:


@example
    mark[0] = 4000;
    mark[1] = 2000;
    space[0] = 1500;
    space[1] = 1500;
    plstyl(2, mark, space);
@end example

To return to a continuous line, just call @code{plstyl} (@pxref{plstyl; Set line style}) with first
argument set to zero. You can use @code{pllsty} (@pxref{pllsty; Select line style}) to choose between 8
different predefined styles.

@node Setting the Area Fill Pattern, Setting Color, Setting Line Attributes, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Setting the Area Fill Pattern

The routine @code{plpat} (@pxref{plpat; Set area fill pattern}) can be used to set the area fill pattern. The
pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of parallel lines with specified
inclinations and spacings. The arguments to this routine are the
number of sets to use (1 or 2) followed by two pointers to integer
arrays (of 1 or 2 elements) specifying the inclinations in tenths of
a degree and the spacing in micrometers (the inclination should be
between -900 and 900). Thus to specify an area fill pattern
consisting of horizontal lines spaced 2 mm apart use:


@example
    *inc = 0;
    *del = 2000;
    plpat(1, inc, del);
@end example

To set up a symmetrical crosshatch pattern with lines directed 30
degrees above and below the horizontal and spaced 1.5 mm apart
use:


@example
    *inc = 300;
    *(inc+1) = -300;
    *del = 1500;
    *(del+1) = 1500;
    plpat(2, inc, del);
@end example

The routine @code{plpsty} (@pxref{plpsty; Select area fill pattern}) can be used to select from 1 of 8 predefined
patterns.

The area fill routines also use the current line style, width and
colors to give a virtually infinite number of different patterns.

@node Setting Color, Setting Character Attributes, Setting the Area Fill Pattern, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Setting Color

Normally, color is used for all drivers and devices that support
it within PLplot subject to the condition that the user has the option
of globally turning off the color (and subsequently turning it on again
if so desired) using @code{plscolor} (@pxref{plscolor; Used to globally turn color output on/off}). 

The PLplot color model utilizes two color maps which can be used
interchangeably. However, color map0 (discussed in @ref{Color Map0,,Color Map0}.) has discrete colors with no particular order
and is most suited to coloring the background, axes, lines, and labels,
and color map1 (discussed in @ref{Color Map1,,Color Map1}.) has
continuously changing colors and is most suited to plots (see @ref{Contour and Shade Plots,,Contour and Shade Plots}.) in which data values are represented by
colors. 

@menu
* Color Map0::
* Color Map1::
@end menu

@node Color Map0, Color Map1, , Setting Color
@subsection Color Map0

Color map0 is most suited to coloring the background, axes,
lines, and labels. Generally, the default color map0 palette of 16
colors is used. (@file{examples/c/x02c.c} illustrates
these colors.) The default background color is taken from the index 0
color which is black by default. The default foreground color is red.

There are a number of options for changing the default red on
black colors. The user may set the index 0 background color using the
command-line @samp{bg} parameter or by calling @code{plscolbg} (@pxref{plscolbg; Set the background color by 8-bit RGB value})
(or @code{plscol0} (@pxref{plscol0; Set a given color from color map0 by 8 bit RGB value}) with a 0 index) @i{before} @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}).
During the course of the plot, the user can change the foreground color
as often as desired using @code{plcol0} (@pxref{plcol0; Set color; map0}) to select the index of the desired
color. 

For more advanced use it is possible to define an arbitrary map0
palette of colors. The user may set the number of colors in the map0
palette using the command-line @samp{ncol0} parameter or by
calling @code{plscmap0n} (@pxref{plscmap0n; Set number of colors in color map0}). @code{plscol0} (@pxref{plscol0; Set a given color from color map0 by 8 bit RGB value}) sets the RGB value of the given index
which must be less than the maximum number of colors (which is set by
default, by command line, by @code{plscmap0n} (@pxref{plscmap0n; Set number of colors in color map0}), or even by @code{plscmap0} (@pxref{plscmap0; Set color map0 colors by 8-bit RGB values})).
Alternatively, @code{plscmap0} (@pxref{plscmap0; Set color map0 colors by 8-bit RGB values}) sets up the entire map0 color palette. For
all these ways of defining the map0 palette any number of colors are
allowed in any order, but it is not guaranteed that the individual
drivers will actually be able to use more than 16 colors. 

@node Color Map1, , Color Map0, Setting Color
@subsection Color Map1

Color map1 is most suited to plots (see @ref{Contour and Shade Plots,,Contour and Shade Plots}.) in which data values are represented by
colors. The data are scaled to the input map1 range of floating point
numbers between 0. and 1. which in turn are mapped (using @code{plcol1} (@pxref{plcol1; Set color; map1})) to
colors using a default or user-specified map1 color transformation. Thus,
there are calls to @code{plcol1} (@pxref{plcol1; Set color; map1}) from within the code for @code{plshade} (@pxref{plshade; Shade individual region on the basis of value}) (see
@file{src/plshade.c}) and @code{plsurf3d} (@pxref{plsurf3d; Plot shaded 3-d surface plot}) (see
@file{src/plot3d.c}) to give a continuous range of
color corresponding to the data being plotted. In addition @code{plcol1} (@pxref{plcol1; Set color; map1}) can
be used to specify the foreground color using the map1 continuous color
palette (see the commented out section of
@file{examples/c/x12c.c} which gives an example of this
for a histogram), but normally @code{plcol0} (@pxref{plcol0; Set color; map0}) is a better tool for this job
(see @ref{Color Map0,,Color Map0}.) since discrete colors often give
a better-looking result. 

For more advanced use it is possible to define an arbitrary map1
palette of colors. The user may set the number of colors in this palette
using the command-line @samp{ncol1} parameter or by calling
@code{plscmap1n} (@pxref{plscmap1n; Set number of colors in color map1}). Furthermore, @code{plscmap1l} (@pxref{plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship}) can be used to set the map1 color
palette using linear interpolation between control points specified in
either RGB or HLS space.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between RGB and HLS color
spaces. RGB space is characterized by three 8-bit unsigned integers
corresponding to the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. Thus,
in hexidecimal notation with the 3 bytes concatanated together the RGB
values of FF0000, FFFF00, 00FF00, 00FFFF, 0000FF, FF00FF, 000000, and
FFFFFF correspond to red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, black, and
white. 

HLS (hue, lightness, and saturation) space is often conceptually
easier to use than RGB space. One useful way to visualize HLS space is
as a volume made up by two cones with their bases joined at the
equator. A given RGB point corresponds to HLS point
somewhere on or inside the double cones, and vice versa. The hue
corresponds to the longitude of the point with 0, 60,
120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees corresponding to red, yellow, green,
cyan, blue, and magenta. The lightness corresponds to the distance along
the axis of the figure of a perpendicular dropped from the HLS point to
the axis. This values ranges from 0 at the south pole to
1 at the north pole. The saturation corresponds to the
distance of the HLS point from the axis with the on-axis value being 0
and the surface value being 1. Full saturation corresponds to full color
while reducing the saturation (moving toward the axis of the HLS figure)
mixes more gray into the color until at zero saturation on the axis of
the figure you have only shades of gray with the variation of lightness
along the axis corresponding to a gray scale. 

Here are some C-code fragments which use @code{plscmap1l} (@pxref{plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship}) to set the
map1 color palette. This first example illustrates how to set up a
gray-scale pallette using linear interpolation in RGB space.

@example
    i[0] = 0.;
    i[1] = 1.;
    /* RGB are rescaled to the range from 0 to 1. for input to plscmap1l.*/
    r[0] = 0.;
    r[1] = 1.;
    g[0] = 0.;
    g[1] = 1.;
    b[0] = 0.;
    b[1] = 1.;
    plscmap1l(1, 2, i, r, g, b, NULL);
@end example

This second example illustrates doing the same thing in HLS
space.

@example
    i[0] = 0.;
    i[1] = 1.;
    /* Hue does not matter for zero saturation.*/
    h[0] = 0.;
    h[1] = 0.;
    /* Lightness varies through its full range.*/
    l[0] = 0.;
    l[1] = 1.;
    /* Saturation is zero for a gray scale.*/
    s[0] = 0.;
    s[1] = 0.;
    /* Note the first argument which specifies HLS space.*/
    plscmap1l(0, 2, i, h, l, s, NULL);
@end example

This final example using @code{plscmap1l} (@pxref{plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship}) illustrates how the default
map1 color pallette is set with just 4 control points (taken from
@file{src/plctrl.c}).

@example
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*\

Finally, @code{plscmap1} (@pxref{plscmap1; Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB values}) is an additional method of setting the map1
color palette directly using RGB space. No interpolation is used with
@code{plscmap1} (@pxref{plscmap1; Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB values}) so it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure that
the colors vary smoothly. Here is an example of the method taken from

@section Setting Character Attributes

Plplot uses two separate font systems to display characters. The
traditional system uses Hershey fonts which are available for all
device drivers, while the recently introduced unicode system is
currently available only for the ps, psc, png, jpeg, and gif devices.
For details on how to enable the unicode font system for additional
device drivers using the FreeType library, see 
@ref{Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers,,Adding FreeType Library Support to Bitmap Drivers}..

@subsection Hershey fonts

There are two Hershey font character sets included with PLplot.
These are known
as the standard and extended character sets. The
standard character set is a subset of the extended set. It contains
177 characters including the ascii characters in a normal style font,
the Greek alphabet and several plotter symbols. The extended
character set contains almost 1000 characters, including four font
styles, and several math, musical and plotter symbols.

The extended character set is loaded into memory automatically when
@code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization}) is called. The standard character set is
loaded by calling @code{plfontld} (@pxref{plfontld; Load character font}). The extended character set requires
about 50 KBytes of memory, versus about 5 KBytes for the standard
set. @code{plfontld} (@pxref{plfontld; Load character font}) can be used to switch between the extended and
standard sets (one set is unloaded before the next is loaded).
@code{plfontld} (@pxref{plfontld; Load character font}) can be called before @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}).

When the extended character set is loaded there are four different
font styles to choose from. In this case, the routine @code{plfont} (@pxref{plfont; Set character font}) sets
up the default Hershey font for all character strings. It may be overridden
for any portion of a string by using an escape sequence within the
text, as described below. This routine has no effect when the
standard font set is loaded. The default font (1) is simple and
fastest to draw; the others are useful for presentation plots on a
high-resolution device.

The font codes are interpreted as follows:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@samp{font = 1}: normal (sans-serif) font

@item
@samp{font = 2}: roman (serif) font

@item
@samp{font = 3}: italic font

@item
@samp{font = 4}: script font
@end itemize

@node Unicode fonts, FCI, Hershey fonts, Setting Character Attributes
@subsection Unicode fonts

The advantages of the unicode fonts over the more traditional PLplot
Hershey fonts are the availability of many additional glyphs
(including mathematical symbols and glyphs from other than
western-European languages) and much better display of characters on
computer screens using anti-aliasing and hinting. Unicode fonts are
obtained by specifying a command-line option of -drvopt text for
the devices (currently ps, psc, png, jpeg, gif, gcw, and wingcc) 
where it has been implemented.

For the ps and psc devices, there is a fixed relationship between the
FCI (font characterization integer, see @ref{FCI,,FCI}.) 
and the actual Type 1
fonts that are being used. This fixed relationship is specified in
the Type1Lookup array in include/plfci.h. This array maps the
font-family attributes of sans-serif, serif, monotype, script, and
symbol to the standard postscript font families called Helvetica,
Times-Roman, Courier, Times-Roman, and Symbol. (There is no script
font family amongst the 35 standard Type 1 postscript fonts so that is
why we map the font-family attribute of script to Times-Roman.)
Similarly, this array maps the font-style attributes of upright,
italic or oblique and the font-weight attributes of medium or bold to
the appropriate variety of the Helvetica, Times-Roman, Courier,
and Symbol font families that are part of the 
35 standard Type 1 postscript fonts. These standard postscript fonts
are normally installed on a user's system using the gsfonts package.

For the devices handled by the FreeType library (currently png, jpeg,
and gif) there is a configurable relationship between the FCI (font
characterization integer, see @ref{FCI,,FCI}.) 
and the TrueType fonts that are actually used. 

On Unix/Linux systems, the TrueType fonts corresponding to the 30 possible
valid FCIs can be specified using ./configure options. (Use
./configure --help to see the possibilities and also the default
values for the fonts.) These ./configure defaults for the 30
possibilites are taken from fonts available from the ttf-freefont font
package. We recommend this font package because it has a rather
complete set of glyphs for most unicode blocks. (We also recommend
the gucharmap application for determining other unicode font
possibilities on your system that are available via the FreeType
library.)

On Windows systems, the fixed default TrueType fonts are specified in the
include/plfci.h file. (NOT PROGRAMMED YET, so this statement
will probably NEED REVISION.)

For all systems, the 30 possible TrueType fonts can be specified at run
time using the following environment variables:

@node FCI, Escape sequences in text, Unicode fonts, Setting Character Attributes
@subsection FCI

We specify the properties of unicode fonts with the FCI (font
characterization integer). The FCI is a 32-bit unsigned integer whose
most significant hexadecimal digit is marked with an 0x8 (0x80000000
is ORed with the FCI value to mark it) to distinguish it from a unicode
(UCS4) integer (whose maximum value 0x7fffffff). Users obtain the
current FCI by calling @code{plgfci} (@pxref{plgfci; Get FCI [font characterization integer]}) and store a new FCI to be used at the
start of each subsequent string using @code{plsfci} (@pxref{plsfci; Set FCI [font characterization integer]}). Independent
hexadecimal values within the FCI are characterized by the hexdigit
and hexpower. The hexpower is defined as the power of 16 or number of
hexadecimal places to the left of the "decimal place" in the FCI 
where the hexdigit is stored. The interpretation of the hexdigit and
hexpower values in the FCI are given in @ref{FCI interpretation,,FCI interpretation}..

Note the maximum value of hexdigit is 7 and the maximum value of
hexpower is 6 so there is substantial room for expansion of this
scheme. On the other hand, since each font attribute is independent
of the rest, what is implemented now gives us a maximum of 30
different font possibilities which is probably more than enough for
most plotting purposes.

@node Escape sequences in text, Character size adjustment, FCI, Setting Character Attributes
@subsection Escape sequences in text

The routines which draw text all allow you to include escape
sequences in the text to be plotted. These are character sequences
that are interpreted as instructions to change fonts, draw
superscripts and subscripts, draw non-ASCII (e.g. Greek), and so on.
All escape sequences start with a number symbol
(@samp{#}) by default. Some language interfaces have
the capability of changing this default, but we will assume
(@samp{#}) in the remaining documentation of the escape
sequences.

The following escape sequences are defined:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@samp{#u}: move up to the superscript position
(ended with @samp{#d})

@item
@samp{#d}: move down to subscript position
(ended with @samp{#u})

@item
@samp{#b}: backspace (to allow overprinting)

@item
@samp{##}: number symbol

@item
@samp{#+}: toggle overline mode

@item
@samp{#-}: toggle underline mode

@item
@samp{#gx}: Greek letter corresponding to Roman
letter @samp{x} (see below)

@item
@samp{#fn}: switch to normal (sans-serif) font

@item
@samp{#fr}: switch to Roman (serif) font

@item
@samp{#fi}: switch to italic font

@item
@samp{#fs}: switch to script font

@item
@samp{#(nnn)}: Hershey character nnn (1 to 4
decimal digits) 

@item
@samp{#[nnn]}: unicode character nnn (nnn can
be decimal or hexadecimal [e.g., starting with 0x]) (UNICODE ONLY).

@item
@samp{#<0x8nnnnnnn>}: absolute FCI to be used to
change fonts in mid-string. (nnnnnnn must be exactly 7
digits). (UNICODE ONLY).

@item
@samp{#<0xmn>}: change just one attribute
of the FCI in mid-string where m is the hexdigit and n is
the hexpower. If more than two digits are given (so long
as the eigth digit does not mark this as an absolute FCI, see
above) they
are ignored. (UNICODE ONLY).

@item
@samp{#<FCI COMMAND STRING/>}: the FCI COMMAND
STRING is currently one of "sans-serif", "serif", "monospace",
"script", "symbol", "upright", "italic", "oblique" "medium",
or "bold" (without the surrounding quotes). These FCI
COMMAND STRINGS change one attribute of the FCI according to
their name. (UNICODE ONLY).
@end itemize

Sections of text can have an underline or overline appended. For
example, the string S-freq is obtained by specifying
@samp{"#+S#+(#-freq#-)"}. 

Greek letters are obtained by @samp{#g} followed by a
Roman letter. @ref{Roman Characters Corresponding to Greek Characters,,Roman Characters Corresponding to Greek Characters}. shows how these letters map
into Greek characters.

the 4 escape sequences @samp{#[nnn]},
@samp{#<0x8nnnnnnn>},

@node Character size adjustment, , Escape sequences in text, Setting Character Attributes
@subsection Character size adjustment

The routine @code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size}) is used to set up the size of subsequent
characters drawn. The actual height of a character is the product of
the default character size and a scaling factor. If no call is made
to @code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size}), the default character size is set up depending on the
number of subpages defined in the call to @code{plstar} (@pxref{plstar; Initialization}) or @code{plstart} (@pxref{plstart; Initialization}), and
the scale is set to 1.0. Under normal circumstances, it is
recommended that the user does not alter the default height, but
simply use the scale parameter. This can be done by calling @code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size})
with @samp{def = 0.0} and @samp{scale} set to
the desired multiple of the default height. If the default height is
to be changed, @samp{def} is set to the new default
height in millimeters, and the new character height is again set to
@samp{def} multiplied by @samp{scale}.

The routine @code{plssym} (@pxref{plssym; Set symbol size}) sets up the size of all subsequent characters drawn
by calls to @code{plpoin} (@pxref{plpoin; Plots a character at the specified points}) and @code{plsym} (@pxref{plsym; Plots a symbol at the specified points}). It operates analogously to
@code{plschr} (@pxref{plschr; Set character size}) as described above.

@node Three Dimensional Surface Plots, Contour and Shade Plots, Setting Character Attributes, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Three Dimensional Surface Plots

PLplot includes routines that will represent a single-valued function
of two variables as a surface. In this section, we shall assume that
the function to be plotted is @samp{Z[X][Y]}, where
@samp{Z} represents the dependent variable and
@samp{X} and @samp{Y} represent the
independent variables.

As usual, we would like to refer to a three dimensional point
@samp{(X, Y, Z)} in terms of some meaningful
user-specified coordinate system. These are called
@i{three-dimensional world coordinates}. We need to
specify the ranges of these coordinates, so that the entire surface
is contained within the cuboid defined by @samp{xmin < x <
xmax}, @samp{ymin < y < ymax}, and
@samp{zmin < z < zmax}. Typically, we shall want
to view the surface from a variety of angles, and to facilitate this,
a two-stage mapping of the enclosing cuboid is performed. Firstly,
it is mapped into another cuboid called the @i{normalized
box} whose size must also be specified by the user, and
secondly this normalized box is viewed from a particular azimuth and
elevation so that it can be projected onto the two-dimensional
window.

This two-stage transformation process allows considerable flexibility
in specifying how the surface is depicted. The lengths of the sides
of the normalized box are independent of the world coordinate ranges
of each of the variables, making it possible to use
reasonable viewing angles even if the ranges of the
world coordinates on the axes are very different. The size of the
normalized box is determined essentially by the size of the
two-dimensional window into which it is to be mapped. The normalized
box is centered about the origin in the @samp{x} and
@samp{y} directions, but rests on the plane @samp{z =
0}. It is viewed by an observer located at altitude
@samp{alt} and azimuth @samp{az}, where both
angles are measured in degrees. The altitude should be restricted to
the range zero to ninety degrees for proper operation, and represents
the viewing angle above the xy plane. The azimuth is defined so that
when @samp{az = 0}, the observer sees the xz plane face
on, and as the angle is increased, the observer moves clockwise
around the box as viewed from above the xy plane. The azimuth can
take on any value.

The first step in drawing a surface plot is to decide on the size of
the two-dimensional window and the normalized box. For example, we
could choose the normalized box to have sides of length


@example
    basex = 2.0;
    basey = 4.0;
    height = 3.0;
@end example

A reasonable range for the x coordinate of the two-dimensional window
is -2.5 to +2.5, since the length of the diagonal across the base of
the normalized box is
sqrt(2^2+4^2) =
2 sqrt(5), which fits into this coordinate range. A reasonable
range for the y coordinate of the two dimensional window in this case
is -2.5 to +4, as the the projection of the normalized box lies in
this range for the allowed range of viewing angles.

The routine @code{plwind} (@pxref{plwind; Specify world coordinates of viewport boundaries}) or @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) is used in the usual way to establish
the size of the two-dimensional window. The routine @code{plw3d} (@pxref{plw3d; Set up window for 3-d plotting}) must
then be called to establish the range of the three dimensional world
coordinates, the size of the normalized box and the viewing angles.
After calling @code{plw3d} (@pxref{plw3d; Set up window for 3-d plotting}), the actual surface is drawn by a call to
@code{plot3d} (@pxref{plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot}).

For example, if the three-dimensional world-coordinate ranges are
-10.0 <= @samp{x} <= 10.0, -3.0 <=
@samp{y} <= +7.0, and 0.0 <= @samp{z}
<= 8.0, we could use the following statements:


@example
    xmin2d = -2.5;
    xmax2d =  2.5;
    ymin2d = -2.5;
    ymax2d =  4.0;
    plenv(xmin2d, xmax2d, ymin2d, ymax2d, 0, -2);
    basex = 2.0;
    basey = 4.0;
    height = 3.0;
    xmin = -10.0;
    xmax = 10.0;
    ymin = -3.0;
    ymax = 7.0;
    zmin = 0.0;
    zmax = 8.0;
    alt = 45.0;
    az = 30.0;
    side = 1;
    plw3d(basex, basey, height, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, alt, az);
    plot3d(x, y, z, nx, ny, opt, side);
@end example

The values of the function are stored in a two-dimensional array
@samp{z[][]} where the array element
@samp{z[i][j]} contains the value of the function at the
point x_i, y_j. (The
two-dimensional array @samp{z} is a vectored array
instead of a fixed size array. @samp{z} points to an
array of pointers which each point to a row of the matrix.) Note
that the values of the independent variables
x_i and y_j do not need
to be equally spaced, but they must lie on a rectangular grid. Thus
two further arrays @samp{x[nx]} and
@samp{y[ny]} are required as arguments to @code{plot3d} (@pxref{plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot}) to
specify the values of the independent variables. The values in the
arrays x and y must be strictly increasing with the index. The
argument @samp{opt} specifies how the surface is
outlined. If @samp{opt = 1}, a line is drawn
representing z as a function of x for each value of y, if
@samp{opt = 2}, a line is drawn representing z as a
function of y for each value of x, and if @samp{opt = 3},
a net of lines is drawn. The first two options may be preferable if
one of the independent variables is to be regarded as a parameter,
whilst the third is better for getting an overall picture of the
surface. If side is equal to one then sides are drawn on the figure
so that the graph doesn't appear to float.

The routine @code{plmesh} (@pxref{plmesh; Plot surface mesh}) is similar to @code{plot3d} (@pxref{plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot}), except that it is used
for drawing mesh plots. Mesh plots allow you to see both the top and
bottom sides of a surface mesh, while 3D plots allow you to see the
top side only (like looking at a solid object). The side option is
not available with @code{plmesh} (@pxref{plmesh; Plot surface mesh}).

Labeling a three-dimensional or mesh plot is somewhat more
complicated than a two dimensional plot due to the need for skewing
the characters in the label so that they are parallel to the
coordinate axes. The routine @code{ plbox3} (@pxref{plbox3; Draw a box with axes; etc; in 3-d}) thus combines the functions of
box drawing and labeling.

@node Contour and Shade Plots, , Three Dimensional Surface Plots, Advanced Use of PLplot
@section Contour and Shade Plots

Several routines are available in PLplot which perform a contour or
shade plot of data stored in a two-dimensional array. The contourer
uses a contour following algorithm so that it is possible to
use non-continuous line styles. Further, one may specify arbitrary
coordinate mappings from array indices to world coordinates, such as
for contours in a polar coordinate system. In this case it is best
to draw the distinction between the C, Fortran 95, and Fortran 77
interfaces so these are handled in turn.

@t{
@b{plcont}
(@i{z}, @i{nx}, @i{ny}, @i{kx}, @i{lx}, @i{ky}, @i{ly}, @i{clevel}, @i{nlevel}, @i{pltr}, @i{pltr_data});}
@end quotation

where @samp{z} is the two-dimensional array of size
@samp{nx} by @samp{ny} containing samples
of the function to be contoured. (@samp{z} is a
vectored two-dimensional array as described in the previous
section. It is @i{not} a fixed-size
two-dimensional array.) The parameters @samp{kx},
@samp{lx}, @samp{ky} and
@samp{ly} specify the portion of @samp{z}
that is to be considered. The array @samp{clevel} of
length @samp{nlevel} is a list of the desired contour
levels.

The path of each contour is initially computed in terms of the
values of the array indices which range from @samp{0}
to @samp{nx-1} in the first index and from
@samp{0} to @samp{ny-1} in the second
index. Before these can be drawn in the current window (see @ref{Defining the Window,,Defining the Window}.), it is necessary to convert from these array
indices into world coordinates. This is done by passing a pointer
@samp{pltr} to a user-defined transformation function 
to @code{plcont} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot}). For C use of @code{plcont} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot}) (and @code{plshade} (@pxref{plshade; Shade individual region on the basis of value}), see next subsection) 
we have included directly in
the PLplot library the following transformation routines:
@code{pltr0} (@pxref{pltr0; Identity transformation for grid to world mapping}) (identity transformation or you can
enter a NULL argument to get the same effect); @code{pltr1} (@pxref{pltr1; Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using singly dimensioned coord arrays})
(linear interpolation in singly dimensioned coordinate arrays);
and @code{pltr2} (@pxref{pltr2; Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using doubly dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as per normal C 2d arrays]}) (linear interpolation in doubly dimensioned coordinate
arrays). Examples of the use of these transformation 
routines are given in @file{examples/c/x09c.c},
@file{examples/c/x14c.c}, and
@file{examples/c/x16c.c}. These same three examples
also demonstrate a user-defined transformation function 
@samp{mypltr} which is capable of 
arbitrary translation, rotation, and/or shear. By defining other
transformation subroutines, it is possible to draw contours wrapped
around polar grids etc.

@subsection Contour Plots from the Fortran 77 interface

The routines mentioned above are not recommended for use directly
from Fortran 77 due to the need to pass a function pointer. That is,
the transformation function is written in C and can not generally
be changed by the user. The call for routine @code{plcontfortran77} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot; fixed linear mapping for Fortran 77}) from
Fortran 77 is then:


@quotation

@t{
call @b{plcont}
(@i{z}, @i{nx}, @i{ny}, @i{kx}, @i{lx}, @i{ky}, @i{ly}, @i{clevel}, @i{nlevel});}
@end quotation

When called from Fortran 77, this routine has the same effect as when invoked
from C. The interpretation of all parameters (see @code{plcont} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot})) is also the
same except there is no transformation function supplied as the last
parameter. Instead, a 6-element array specifying coefficients to use in the
transformation is supplied via the named common block
@samp{plplot} (see code).
Since this approach is somewhat
inflexible, the user is recommended to call either of @code{plcon0} (@pxref{plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran 77}), @code{plcon1} (@pxref{plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran 77}), or
@code{plcon2} (@pxref{plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d mapping for Fortran 77}) instead for Fortran 77.

The three routines recommended for use from Fortran 77 are @code{plcon0} (@pxref{plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran 77}),
@code{plcon1} (@pxref{plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran 77}), and @code{plcon2} (@pxref{plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d mapping for Fortran 77}). These routines are similar to existing
commercial plot package contour plotters in that they offer
successively higher complexity, with @code{plcon0} (@pxref{plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran 77}) utilizing no
transformation arrays, while those used by @code{plcon1} (@pxref{plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran 77}) and @code{plcon2} (@pxref{plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d mapping for Fortran 77})
are one and two dimensional, respectively. The call syntax for
each is


@quotation

@t{
call @b{plcon0}
(@i{z}, @i{nx}, @i{ny}, @i{kx}, @i{lx}, @i{ky}, @i{ly}, @i{clevel}, @i{nlevel});}
@end quotation

@quotation

@t{
call @b{plcon1}
(@i{z}, @i{nx}, @i{ny}, @i{kx}, @i{lx}, @i{ky}, @i{ly}, @i{clevel}, @i{nlevel}, @i{xg1}, @i{yg1});}
@end quotation

@quotation

@t{
call @b{plcon2}
(@i{z}, @i{nx}, @i{ny}, @i{kx}, @i{lx}, @i{ky}, @i{ly}, @i{clevel}, @i{nlevel}, @i{xg2}, @i{yg2});}
@end quotation

The @code{plcon0} (@pxref{plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran 77}) routine is implemented via a call to @code{plcont} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot}) with a
very simple (identity) transformation function, while @code{plcon1} (@pxref{plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran 77}) and
@code{plcon2} (@pxref{plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d mapping for Fortran 77}) use interpolating transformation functions as well as
a call to
@code{plcont} (@pxref{plcont; Contour plot}).

The transformation arrays are used by these routines to specify a
mapping between the computational coordinate system and the
physical one. For example, the transformation to polar coordinates
might look like:


@example
    do i = 1, NX
        do j = 1, NY
            xg(i, j) = r(i) * cos( theta(j) )
            yg(i, j) = r(i) * sin( theta(j) )
        enddo
    enddo
@end example

assuming the user had already set up arrays @samp{r}
and @samp{theta} to specify the (r, theta) values at
the gridpoints in his system. For this example, it is recommended
that the user add an additional cell in theta such that
@samp{xg(i, NY+1) = xg(i, 1)} and @samp{yg(i, NY+1)
= yg(i, 1)} so that the contours show the proper periodic
behavior in theta (see also example program 9).

The transformation function not only specifies the transformation
at grid points, but also at intermediate locations, via linear
interpolation. For example, in the @samp{pltr1}
transformation function used by @code{plcon1} (@pxref{plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for Fortran 77}), the 1-d interpolation to
get @samp{tx} as a function of @samp{x}
looks like (in C):


@example
    ul = (PLINT)x;
    ur = ul + 1;
    du = x - ul;

    xl = *(xg+ul);
    xr = *(xg+ur);

    *tx = xl * (1-du)  +  xr * du;
@end example

while in Fortran 77 this might look like:


@example
    lxl = x
    lxr = lxl + 1
    dx = x - lxl

    xl = xg(lxl)
    xr = xg(lxr)

    tx = xl * (1-dx)  +  xr * dx
@end example

@node Deploying programs that use PLplot, The PLplot Display Driver Family, Advanced Use of PLplot, Top
@chapter Deploying programs that use PLplot

This chapter provides some information on the issue of
delivering programs that use PLplot: what files should be installed and
where, what environment variables are involved and related matters.

The scenario is this: You have created one or more programs that run
successfully on your development machine and now you need to install
them on the machine of a user.

One solution is to provide him or her with the full development
environment that you use, but that is in general only an option if your
user is comfortable with making programs themselves. A more common
situation is that your user just wants the executable programs and
wants to get using them rightaway. We will focus on this particular
solution, as there are a few non-trivial issues.

To be absolutely clear about what we are describing, here is a summary:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Your program must run on a machine that does not have PLplot
installed from the sources.

@item
There is no development environment that you can rely on.

@item
The program should be installed in a self-contained directory
structure (which @i{can} be
@file{/usr/local} or @file{c:\program}
files or whatever, but need not be so).
@end itemize

Under Linux, the easiest way to install a binary version of PLplot on a
user's machine is to use PLplot deb binary packages for the @uref{http://www.debian.org,Debian} distribution, and PLplot rpm
binary packages for rpm-based distributions. (See the @uref{http://plplot.sourceforge.net/resources/index.html,Resources  area} of the PLplot web site for locations of debs and rpms.)
Build the application on the build machine using the results of the
@samp{plplot-config --cflags --libs} command, and copy
the resulting executable(s) to the users' machines.

Under Unix (and also under Linux if you would prefer to use a newer
version of PLplot than is available in the debs or rpms), a good way
to deploy binary PLplot and applications that depend on that binary PLplot
on users' machines is as follows:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Use the @code{./configure} option
@samp{--prefix=/usr/local/plplot} (or some other
unique but consistent directory that is available on the build
machine and all users' machines).

@item
Build and install as normal on the build machine.

@item
Copy the installed PLplot tree,
@file{/usr/local/plplot}, into a tarball.

@item
Unpack that tarball on all users' machines in the same location
@file{/usr/local/plplot}.

@item
Build the application(s) on the build machine using the results
of the @samp{plplot-config --cflags --libs}
command, and copy the resulting executable(s) to the users'
machines. Since the PLplot install location is consistent on all
machines, the application should work the same way on all
machines.
@end itemize

On Windows, and also those rare Linux/Unix cases where you cannot install
the PLplot install tree in a consistent location on users' machines, then
there are some additional options you need to consider.

There are three situations depending on how you configure and
build the PLplot libraries:

@enumerate 

@item
You use the static versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
which are not dynamically loaded.
@footnote{
UNIX-like systems libraries can be static or shared, the first
type becoming part of the program, the second existing as a
separate file. On Windows the terms are respectively static
and dynamic (the latter type is also known as DLL).
}

@item
You use the shared versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
which are not dynamically loaded.

@item
You use the shared versions of the PLplot library and devices
which are dynamically loaded. This combination is the default
option under Unix/Linux.
@end enumerate

In the @i{first} case the program will contain all the
code it needs to work, but to run successfully, it needs to find the
font files, @file{plstnd5.fnt} and
@file{plxtnd5.fnt}. The mechanism used in PLplot to find
these files is fairly simple:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
It looks at a number of built-in places, determined at the time
the PLplot library itself was installed and built. For deployment
these places are irrelevant in general.

@item
It looks at the environment variables
@code{PLPLOT_LIB} and @code{PLPLOT_HOME}.
(Actually, this happens only, if the corresponding compiler
macros @code{PLPLOT_LIB_ENV} and
@code{PLPLOT_HOME_ENV} were defined at compile time.)

@item
@i{(TODO: remark about Mac)}
@end itemize

Note: This is also the place to put the geographical map files, if you
happen to use them.

The environment variables should point to the directory holding the two
font files or the one above (one variable is enough though):

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@code{PLPLOT_LIB} should point to the directory
actually holding these files

@item
@code{PLPLOT_HOME} should point to the directory that
holds a subdirectory @file{lib}
which in turn holds these files.
@end itemize

If it can find these, PLplot can do its job.

Note: This is the case for instance when you use the static PLplot
library on Windows (see the directory
@file{sys\win32\msdev\plplib}).

In the @i{second } case the font and map files are found
as in the @i{first} case. In addition, you also
require another environment variable so the PLplot shared libraries can
be found at run time by the run-time loader. The details depend on the
system you are working on, but here are some common platforms:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Most UNIX, BSD and Linux systems use an environment variable
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} which indicates 
directories where shared libraries can be found. Some use
@code{SHLIB_PATH}, like HPUX.

@item
On Windows the PATH variable is used to find the DLLs, but
beware: Windows uses a number of places to find the DLLs a
program needs and the ordering seems to depend on some intricate
details. It seems easiest and safest to put the DLLs in the same
directory as your program.

@item
On MacOSX, ... @i{TODO}
@end itemize

In the @i{third} (default) case, the PLplot fonts and
maps are found as in the @i{first} case, and the 
shared libraries are found as in the @i{second} case,
but in addition the separated dynamic devices have to be found as well.

When PLplot uses dynamic devices, it first builds up a list of them, by
examining a directory which contains files describing those devices:
the @file{*.rc} files. Each of these files indicates what
the relevant properties for the device or devices. Then when the
device is actually needed, the corresponding shared object (or plug-in
or DLL depending on your terminology) is dynamically loaded.

The directory that contains all these files (the device descriptions as
well as the actual libraries and the description files that libtool
uses) is a directory determined at the time you configured
PLplot which is typically something like
@file{/usr/local/plplot/lib/plplot5.3.1/driversd}. This
directory must be pointed to by the @code{PLPLOT_DRV_DIR}
environment variable. Again for deployment, only the environment
variable is of real interest.

To summarise the case where you don't have a deb or rpm option, and
you must use inconsistent install locations on your users' machines:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
The following environment variables are important:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@code{PLPLOT_HOME} or
@code{PLPLOT_LIB} to indicate the position of
font files (and also of the various geographic maps)

@item
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH},
@code{SHLIB_PATH} or @code{PATH} to
find the dynamic/shared libraries

@item
@code{PLPLOT_DRV_DIR} to find the device
descriptions
@end itemize

@item
The following files being part of PLplot must be distributed
along with your program:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
The font files (@file{plstnd5.fnt} and
@file{plxtnd5.fnt}) and, possibly, if you use
them, the geographic map files.

@item
The PLplot shared libraries

@item
The device description files and the device shared object files
@end itemize
@end itemize

All the environment variables, except
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} and equivalents, can be set within
the program (by using a small configuration file or by determining the
position of the files relative to the program's location). They just
have be set before PLplot is initialised.

The GCW driver plots each page into an individual tab within
a Gnome window. The user interface built into the window allows 
a variety of actions. In particular, pages can be saved to files
with extensions .ps, .psc, .png, .jpg, and .gif, which correspond 
to PLplot output driver devices described in 
@ref{The PLplot Output Driver Family,,The PLplot Output Driver Family}..

The GCW driver supports anti-aliasing and is unicode enabled.

There are a variety of hot keys that may be used in the user interface:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
= : Zooms to 100%

@item

The available driver options (used with the
@code{-drvopt} command-line argument) are:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
text: Use TrueType fonts (0|1); default 1

@item
pixmap: Use pixmap for plotting lines and shades (0|1); 
default 1

@item
hrshsym: Use Hershey symbol set (0|1); default 0
@end itemize

The @code{text} option toggles between TrueType and
Hershey fonts. The Hershey fonts provide a reference implementation
for text representation in PLplot.

The @code{hrshsym} option is used to indicate that
symbols should be drawn using the Hershey fonts. This is
useful when plots need to be saved to PostScript files, because
the Type I fonts used by the PS and PSC devices do not support all
Unicode symbols.

Most of the command-line arguments described in
@ref{Command Line Arguments,,Command Line Arguments}. are also supported. Some key arguments
for use with the GCW driver are:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
geometry geom: Sets page size, in pixels (e.g. -geometry 400x300)

@item
nopixmap: Disables pixmap usage for plotting lines and shades

@item
portrait: Sets portrait mode (both orientation and aspect ratio)
@end itemize

The @code{nopixmap} option disables the use of
the internal pixmap for drawing lines and shades, which will 
normally appear somewhat pixelated. The 
@code{nopixmap} option directs the driver to use 
anti-aliased vector graphics instead, resulting in higher quality
plots but rendered at a slower speed. This option does not affect 
the quality of plots saved from the GCW user interface. Note that
the TrueType fonts are always anti-aliased.

@node GCW Driver API, , GCW Driver Basics, The GCW Driver [Gnome 2]

The GCW driver provides an additional API that allows for a higher
degree of control by the user. The C API is described below, and
bindings to other languages are described in

Programs that need access to this API must be linked against the 
libplplotgnome2d library rather than libplplotd. This is most easily 
accomplished using pkg-config; i.e.,

@example

The PostScript driver produces publication-quality PostScript
output. The driver provides two devices: the ps device for 
black-and-white plots, and the psc device for color plots.

This driver is unicode enabled, and PostScript Type I fonts are used.
Type I fonts do not have all of the available unicode symbols
represented. For this reason, Hershey fonts are used for drawing 
symbols by default, unless specified otherwise using the driver options.

The available driver options are:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
text: Use PostScript text (0|1); default 1

@item
color: Use color (0|1); default 1

@item
hrshsym: Use Hershey fonts for symbols (0|1); default 1
@end itemize

@node The TrueType PostScript Driver, The LaTeX PostScript Driver, The PostScript Driver, The PLplot Output Driver Family
@section The TrueType PostScript Driver

This is a PostScript driver that supports TrueType fonts. This 
allows access to a far greater range of fonts and characters than 
is possible using Type 1 PostScript fonts 
(see @ref{The PostScript Driver,,The PostScript Driver}.).
It is the driver to use for generating publication quality output
using PLplot. The driver provides two devices: the ps-ttf device
for black-and-white plots and the ps-ttfc device for color plots.

The driver requires the LASi (v1.0.5), pango and pangoft2 libraries 
to work. The pango and pangoft2 libraries are widely distributed 
with most Linux distributions and give the psttf driver full complex 
text layout (CTL) capability (see 
@uref{http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php,  http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php}
for an example of this capability). The LASi library is not part of 
most distributions at this time. The source code can be downloaded 
from http://www.unifont.org/lasi/. The library is small and easy to 
build and install. Make sure you use LASi-1.0.5. The psttf device 
driver uses new capabilities in this version of LASi and no longer 
works with LASi-1.0.4.

The available driver options are:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item

@node The LaTeX PostScript Driver, The SVG Driver, The TrueType PostScript Driver, The PLplot Output Driver Family
@section The LaTeX PostScript Driver

This is a PostScript device driver that writes out its results in two
files. (1) The encapsulated postscript (EPS) file contains all the
postscript commands for rendering the plot without characters, and (2)
the LaTeX file contains a fragment of LaTeX that reads in the EPS file
and renders the plot characters using LaTeX commands (and LaTeX
fonts!) in alignment with the EPS file to produce a combined result.

Suppose you create the EPS and LaTeX files with the following command:
@samp{./x01c -dev pstex -o x01c.eps}. The EPS file
is then stored in @file{x01c.eps} and the LaTeX fragment
is stored in @file{x01c.eps_t}. Then
you may use the generated files with the @file{x01c.tex}
LaTeX code that follows:


@example
\documentclass@{article@}
\usepackage[dvips]@{graphicx@}
\begin@{document@}
\input@{x01c.eps_t@}
\end@{document@}
@end example

and generate PostScript results using the LaTeX fonts with the following
command: @samp{latex x01c.tex; dvips -f <x01c.dvi >x01c.ps
}. The results look good (aside from an obvious bounding-box
problem that still needs to be fixed with this device) and should be
useful for LaTeX enthusiasts.

There are no available driver options.

@node The SVG Driver, , The LaTeX PostScript Driver, The PLplot Output Driver Family
@section The SVG Driver

The SVG driver produces Scalable Vector Graphics files that are 
compliant with the SVG 1.1 specification as defined here:
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/. The driver is unicode enabled
and both text and lines are anti-aliased. As SVG is just an
XML based graphics language, the visual quality of the resulting 
plot will depend on the SVG rendering engine that is used and
what fonts that are available to it.

@chapter C Language

(OLD, NEEDS DOCUMENTATION UPDATING)
The argument types given in this manual (PLFLT and PLINT) are typedefs for
the actual argument type. A PLINT is actually a type
@samp{long} and should not be changed. A PLFLT can be either a
@samp{float} or @samp{double}; this choice is made
when the package is installed and on a Unix system (for example) may result
in a PLplot library named @file{libplplot.a} in single
precision and @file{libplplotd.a} in double precision.

These and other constants used by PLplot are defined in the main header file
@file{plplot.h}, which must be included by the user program. This file also
contains all of the function prototypes, machine dependent defines, and
redefinition of the C-language bindings that conflict with the Fortran names
(more on this later). @file{plplot.h} obtains its values for PLFLT, PLINT,
and PLARGS (a macro for conditionally generating prototype argument lists)
from FLOAT (typedef), INT (typedef), and PROTO (macro), respectively.
The latter are defined in the file
@file{chdr.h}. The user is encouraged to use FLOAT, INT, and PROTO in
his/her own code, and modify @file{chdr.h} according to taste. It is not
actually necessary to declare variables as FLOAT and INT except when they
are pointers, as automatic conversion to the right type will otherwise occur
(if using a Standard C compiler; else K&R style automatic promotion will
occur). The only code in @file{plplot.h} that directly depends on these
settings is as follows:

@example

#include "plplot/chdr.h"

/* change from chdr.h conventions to plplot ones */

typedef FLOAT PLFLT;
typedef INT   PLINT;
#define PLARGS(a) PROTO(a)
@end example

PLplot is capable of being compiled with Standard C (ANSI) mode on or off.
This is toggled via the macro PLSTDC, and set automatically if __STDC__
is defined. If PLSTDC is defined, all functions are prototyped as allowed
under Standard C, and arguments passed exactly as specified in the
prototype. If PLSTDC is not defined, however, function prototypes are
turned off and K&R automatic argument promotion will occur, e.g.
@samp{ float &rarr; double, int &rarr; long}.
There is no middle ground! A PLplot
library built with PLSTDC defined will not work (in general) with a program
built with PLSTDC undefined, and vice versa. It is possible in principle to
build a library that will work under both Standard C and K&R compilers
simultaneously (i.e. by duplicating the K&R promotion with the Standard C
prototype), but this seems to violate the spirit of the C standard and can
be confusing. Eventually we will drop support for non-standard C compilers
but for now have adopted this compromise.

In summary, PLplot will work using either a Standard or non-standard C
compiler, provided that you :

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Include the PLplot main header file @file{plplot.h}.

@item
Make sure all pointer arguments are of the correct type
(the compiler should warn you if you forget, so don't worry, be happy).

@item
Do not link a code compiled with PLSTDC defined to a PLplot library
compiled with PLSTDC undefined, or vice versa.

@item
Use prototypes whenever possible to reduce type errors.
@end itemize

Note that some Standard C compilers will give warnings when converting a
constant function argument to whatever is required by the prototype. These
warnings can be ignored.

The one additional complicating factor concerns the use of stub routines to
interface with Fortran (see the following section for more explanation). On
some systems, the Fortran and C namespaces are set up to clobber each other.
More reasonable (from our viewpoint) is to agree on a standard map between
namespaces, such as the appending of an underscore to Fortran routine names
as is common on many Unix-like systems. The only case where the shared
Fortran/C namespaces do any good is when passing a pointer to a like data
type, which represents only a small fraction of the cases that need to
be handled (which includes constant values passed on the stack, strings, and
two-dimensional arrays).

There are several ways to deal with this situation, but the least messy from
a user's perspective is to redefine those PLplot C function names which
conflict with the Fortran-interface stub routines. The actual function
names are the same as those described in this document, but with a
c_
prepended. These macro definitions appear in the
@file{plplot.h} header file
and are otherwise harmless. Therefore you can (and should) forget that most
of the names are being redefined to avoid the conflict and simply adhere to
the bindings as described in this manual. Codes written under old versions
of PLplot (previous to 5.0) will require a recompile, however.

programs (@file{x01c.c} through @file{x19c.c})

@node Fortran 95 Language, Fortran 77 Language, C Language, Top
@chapter Fortran 95 Language

As discussed in the preceding section, PLplot's integer representation is a
PLINT and its floating point representation is a PLFLT. To the
Fortran 95 user, this most commonly translates to a type
@samp{integer} and
type @samp{real}, respectively. This is somewhat system dependent (and up to
the installer of the package) so you should check the release notes to be
sure, or just try it and see what happens.

Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used in the
description of each PLplot function. Thus to understand this manual it is
helpful to know a little about C, but fortunately the translation is very
easy and can be summarized here. As an example, the routine
@code{plline} (@pxref{plline; Draw a line}) call from C would look like:

@example

	plline(n,x,y);
@end example

@noindent
The argument @samp{n} is the number of points that make
up the line and the arguments @samp{x} and @samp{y}
are arrays of floating-point numbers containing the x- and y-coordinates of the
points.

In C you need to specify the array dimensions explicitly, whereas in
Fortran 95 the array dimension can be implicit, which leads to less
mistakes. The interface to @samp{plline} would ideally look
like this:

@example

	interface
		subroutine plline(x,y)
		real, dimension(:) :: x, y
		end subroutine plline
	end interface
@end example

@noindent
This is the way of calling PLplot routines in Fortran 95 - it is less
error-prone than the Fortran 77 way (see the chapter on Fortran 77).
@footnote{
The Fortran 77 way is still available: you can call the routine
@samp{pllinef77} that has the same argument list as the
Fortran 77 routine @samp{plline}. This is not documented,
however, other than by this note.
}

There is one slight complication: PLplot can be compiled with either
single-precision reals or double-precision reals. It is @i{very
important} to keep the variables that are passed to PLplot in
the same precision. Fortunately, Fortran 95 provides the
@samp{KIND} mechanism for this.

The actual interface to @samp{plline} therefore looks like:

@example

	interface
		subroutine plline(x,y)
		real(kind=plflt), dimension(:) :: x, y
		end subroutine plline
	end interface
@end example

@noindent
The parameter @samp{plflt} is defined in the
@samp{PLplot} module and should be used consistently with
all real variables that you pass to PLplot routines.

Here is a short overview of how C data types correspond to Fortran 95
data types:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item
PLFLT@tab real(kind=plflt)
@item
PLINT@tab integer
@item
char *@tab character
@item
PLFLT *@tab real(kind=plflt) or real(kind=plflt), dimension(:)
@item
PLFLT **@tab real(kind=plflt), dimension(:,:)
@item
@samp{"string"}@tab @samp{'string'}
@item
array[0]@tab array(1)
@end multitable

@noindent
In C there are two ways to pass a variable --- by value (the default) or by
reference (pointer), whereas only the latter is used by Fortran 95.
Therefore when you see references in the text to @i{either} an ordinary
argument or a pointer argument (e.g. @samp{*data}), you simply use an
ordinary Fortran 95 variable or array name (the interfacing
routines take care of any transformations that may be necessary).

The PLplot library comes with a set of Fortran 95 interface routines that
allow the same call semantics (usually) regardless of whether calling
from C or Fortran 95. In some cases, the Fortran 95 interface uses
implicit array dimensions, so that it has fewer arguments than the C
counterpart.

These stub routines handle transforming the data
from the normal Fortran 95 representation to that typically used in C. This
includes:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Variables passed by value instead of by reference.

Fortran 95 passes all subroutine arguments by reference, i.e., a pointer to the
argument value is pushed on the stack. In C all values, except for arrays
(including char arrays), are passed by value, i.e., the argument value
itself is pushed on the stack. The stub routine converts the Fortran 95 call
by reference to a call by value. As an example, here is how the plpoin stub
routine works. In your Fortran 95 program you might have a call to plpoin that
looks something like

@example

      real(kind=pllft), dimension(6) :: x, y
      x = ...
      y = ...
      call plpoin(x,y,9)
@end example

@noindent
where x and y are arrays with 6 elements and you want to plot symbol 9.
The routine @samp{plpoin} calls the underlying routine
@samp{plpoinf77}:

@example

      subroutine plpoin( x, y, code )
         integer                        :: code
         real(kind=plflt), dimension(:) :: x, y

         call plpoinf77( size(x), x, y, code )
      end subroutine plpoin
@end example

@noindent
This takes care of the size of the arrays - it is not possible to
transfer this information to C in an implicit way.

The routine plpoinf77 is implemented in C to take care of the question
pass by value or pass by reference:
@footnote{
@samp{PLPOIN} is a macro that get translated into the correct name
for this routine - various Fortran compilers use different conventions, such as
adding an underscore or translating the name into capitals.
}

@example

#include "plplot/plstubs.h"

void
PLPOIN(n, x, y, code)
PLINT *n, *code;
PLFLT *x, *y;
@{
    c_plpoin(*n, x, y, *code);
@}
@end example

@noindent
All this stub routine does is convert the number of points
(@samp{*n} and the
symbol @samp{*code} to call by value (i.e. pushes their value on the stack)
and then calls the C plpoin library routine.

@item
Get mapping between Fortran 95 and C namespace right (system dependent).

The external symbols (i.e. function and subroutine names) as you see them
in your program often appear differently to the linker. For example, the
Fortran 95 routine names may be converted to uppercase or lowercase, and/or
have an underscore appended or prepended. This translation is handled
entirely via redefinition of the stub routine names, which are macros.
During the build process, the properties of the build environment are
detected and the correct compiler options are used.

Once the name translation is established during installation, name
translation is completely transparent to the user.

@item
Translation of character string format from Fortran 95 to C.

Fortran 95 character strings are passed differently than other quantities, in
that a string descriptor is pushed on the stack along with the string
address. C doesn't want the descriptor, it wants a NULL terminated string.
For routines that handle strings two stub routines are necessary, one
written in Fortran 95 and one written in C. Your Fortran 95 program calls the
Fortran 95 stub routine first. This stub converts the character string to a
null terminated integer array and then calls the C stub routine. The C
stub routine converts the integer array (type @samp{long}) to the usual C
string representation (which may be different, depending on whether your
machine uses a big endian or little endian byte ordering; in any case the
way it is done in PLplot is portable). See the @samp{plmtex} stubs for an
example of this.

Note that the portion of a Fortran 95 character string that exceeds 299
characters will not be plotted by the text routines (@samp{plmtex}
and @samp{plptex}).

@item
Multidimensional array arguments are changed from row-dominant to
column-dominant ordering through use of a temporary array.

In Fortran 95, arrays are always stored so that the first index increases most
rapidly as one steps through memory. This is called
row-dominant
storage. In C, on the other hand, the first index increases
@i{least}
rapidly, i.e. column-dominant ordering. Thus, two dimensional arrays
(e.g. as passed to the contour or surface plotting routines) passed into
PLplot must be transposed in order to get the proper two-dimensional
relationship to the world coordinates. This is handled in the C stub
routines by dynamic memory allocation of a temporary array. This is then set
equal to the transpose of the passed in array and passed to the appropriate
PLplot routine. The overhead associated with this is normally not important
but could be a factor if you are using very large 2d arrays.
@end itemize

This all seems a little messy, but is very user friendly. Fortran 95 and C
programmers can use the same basic interface to the library, which is a
powerful plus for this method. The fact that stub routines are being used
is completely transparent to the Fortran 95 programmer.

be defined for that platform).

@chapter A C++ Interface for PLplot

PLplot has long had C and Fortran bindings, presenting a fairly
conventional API to the applications programmer. Recently (1994
onwards) PLplot has been growing interfaces (language bindings) to a
variety of other languages. In this chapter we discuss the PLplot C++
support provided in the PLplot distribution. Of course many other
approaches are possible, perhaps even in use by PLplot users around
the world. The purpose of this chapter then is to explain the
rationale and intended usage for the bundled C++ language support.

@section Motivation for the C++ Interface

PLplot has a fairly complex C API. There are lots of functions, and
several facilities have multiple entry points with similar names but
different argument lists. (Think contouring, shading). Often these
differing argument lists are to accommodate a variety of data storage
paradigms, one of which you are expected to be using!

Especially in the case of the 2-d API's for contouring and shading,
sophisticated C++ users may feel a special sense of exasperation with
the data layout prescriptions, since they are extremely primitive,
pointer rich, and prone to a wide class of memory leaks and other
sorts of programming errors. Many C++ users know good and well that
better ways exist (templated matrix classes, etc), but historically
have not been able to use these more sophisticated techniques if the
contained data ever needed to get plotted.

Besides the 2-d API functions, there is also the multiple output
stream capability of PLplot. Anyone who knows C++ well, and who has
used multiple output streams in PLplot, has probably noticed striking
similarities between the PLplot @samp{PLStream} pointer and the C++ 
@samp{this} pointer. Although multiple output streams have not been 
widely used in PLplot applications in the past, the availability of
the plframe Tk widget, and the extended wish concept, is making it
much more attractive to use multiple output streams.

Unfortunately, if you do write a Tk extended wish application, and
endow your interface with multiple plframes, the event driven
character of X applications makes it difficult to ensure that PLplot
output shows up in the right plframe window. If a plot is generated
to one plframe, the PLplot @samp{PLStream} pointer is directed to that
stream. If a user then pushes a Tk button which should generate a
plot to a different plframe, the plot goes to the old plframe instead!
Schemes for controlling this can be imagined, but the logic can be
complex, especially in the face of the ability to /also/ make plots to
the same plframe from either Tcl or C++.

Beyond this, the C API is downright "ugly" for a significant number of
the functions, particularly those which return values by accepting
pointers to variables in their argument lists, and then changing them
in that way. Sophisticated C++ users generally take considerable
pride in banishing the offensive bare pointer from their code, and
consider it disgusting to have to insert &'s just in order to make a
call to an API function.

In order to address these issues (and more), I have begun constructing
a C++ interface to PLplot. The purpose of this missive is to describe
its architecture and usage.

@node Stream/Object Identity, Namespace Management, , Design of the PLplot C++ Interface
@subsection Stream/Object Identity

A C++ class named @samp{plstream} has been introduced. It's central
purpose is provide a specific, object based encapsulation of the
concept of a PLplot output stream. Any output produced using a
@samp{plstream} object, will go to the PLplot output stream associated with
that object, regardless of what stream may have been active before. 

In order to write a multiple output stream PLplot application, a C++
program can declare @samp{plstream} objects, and invoke drawing methods on
those objects, without regard to ordering considerations or other
coherency considerations. Although this has obvious simplification
benefit even for simple programs, the full benefit is most easily
appreciated in the context of Tk extended wish applications in which a
@samp{plstream} can be associated with each plframe.

@node Namespace Management, Abstraction of Data Layout, Stream/Object Identity, Design of the PLplot C++ Interface
@subsection Namespace Management

The PLplot C API is composed of a set of drawing functions, all
prefixed with "pl", in an effort to prevent namespace collision.
However, the prefix "pl" is gratuitous, and in particular is
unnecessary in a C++ context. The @samp{plstream} class mirrors most
of the PLplot C API, but does so by dropping the "pl" prefix. The
@samp{plstream} class thus serves to collect the PLplot drawing
functions into a scope in which collisions with other similarly named
functions is not a concern. So, where a C programmer might write:

@example

        plsstrm( 1 );
	plenv( ... );
	plline( ... );
@end example

The C++ programmer can write:

@example

	plstream p( ... );
	p.env( ... );
	p.line( ... );
@end example

Is that an important benefit? The utility varies with the number of
output streams in use in the program.

plmkstrm() is replaced by object declaration. plsstrm() is replaced by
method invocation on the desired output stream object. plgstrm() is
rendered irrelevant.

The skeptic may say, "But you have to type the same number of
characters! You've replaced 'pl' with 'p.', except it could be worse
for a longer object name." True. BUT, in this new scheme, most plots
will not be generated by invoking methods on a specific stream object,
but rather by deriving from @samp{plstream}, and invoking methods of
"this" object. See the section on derivation below.

@node Abstraction of Data Layout, Collapsing the API, Namespace Management, Design of the PLplot C++ Interface
@subsection Abstraction of Data Layout

The @samp{plstream} class will provide an abstract interface to the
2-d drawing functions. Instead of forcing the C++ user to organize
data in one of a small set of generally braindead data layouts with
poor memory management properties, potentially forcing the C++ user to
not use a superior method, or to copy data computed in one layout
format to another for plotting (with consequent bug production), the
@samp{plstream} 2-d plotting functions will accept an abstract layout
specification. The only thing which is important to the 2-d drawing
functions is that the data be "indexable". They should not care about
data layout.

Consequently, an abstract class, "Contourable_Data" is provided. This
class provides a pure virtual method which accepts indexes, and is to
be made to produce a function value for the user's 2-d data field. It
is of no concern to PLplot how the user does this. Any mapping
between index and data which the user wishes to use, may be used.

This methodology allows the C++ user to compute data using whatever
storage mechanism he wants. Then, by deriving a class from PLplot's
Contourable_Data abstract class, he can provide a mapping to his own
data layout.

Note that this does /not/ mean that the C++ user's internal data
layout must be derived from PLplot's Contourable_Data class. Suppose
for example that the user data is stored in a C++ "matrix" class.
To make this data contourable, the user may define a class which
specializes the indexing concept of the PLplot Contourable_Data class
to his matrix class. For example:

@example

class Matrix @{ ... @};
class Contourable_Matrix : public Contourable_Data @{
    Matrix& m;
  public:
    Contourable_Matrix( Matrix& _m ) : m(_m) @{@}
    PLFLT  operator()( int i, int j ) const @{ return m(i,j); @}
@};

plstream p( ... );
Matrix m;
// Code to fill m with data
Contourable_Matrix cm(m);
p.shade( cm, ... );
@end example

In this way the C++ user is completely freed from the tyranny of
moronic data layout constraints imposed by PLplot's C or Fortran API.

@node Collapsing the API, , Abstraction of Data Layout, Design of the PLplot C++ Interface
@subsection Collapsing the API

Use of abstraction as in C) above will allow a single method in
@samp{plstream} to perform the services of multiple functions in the C API.
In those cases where multiple functions were provided with different
data layout specifications, but similar functionality, these can all
be collapsed into one, through the use of the abstract interface
technique described above.
Moreover, function name overloading can be used to simplify the
namespace for those cases where multiple functions were used to get
variations on a basic capability. For example, a single name such as
contour or shade can be used for multiple methods taking different
argument sets, so that for example, one can make simple plots of
rectangular data sets, or more complex generalized coordinate
mappings.

@node Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface, Status of the C++ Interface, Design of the PLplot C++ Interface, A C++ Interface for PLplot
@section Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface

The @samp{plstream} class is an ideal candidate for derivation. By
inheriting from @samp{plstream}, the user can construct a new class
which is automatically endowed with the ability to plot to a specific
PLplot output stream in a coherent manner without having to worry
about interplay with other @samp{plstream} (or derived type) objects.
Moreover, new, higher level, plotting functionality can be constructed
to provide even more simplicity and ease of use than the PLplot API.

The PLplot maintainers (Geoff and Maurice) expect to introduce a class
plxstream in the future which provides superior support for
constructing graphics with multiple plots per page, easier
specification of plot adornments, etc. This should significantly ease
one aspect of PLplot usage which we regard as being clumsy at this
time.

Beyond that, users may find it useful to derive from
@samp{plstream}
(or later plxstream whenever it finally makes its appearance) for the
purpose of making "application specific" output streams. For example,
a C++ program will normally have a variety of objects which constitute
the fundamental entities in the code. These could all be made to be
"atomically plotted" by providing suitable methods. For example:

@example

class Cat @{ ... @};
class Dog @{ ... @};
class Bear @{ ... @};
class Fish @{ ... @};

class zoostream : public plstream @{
  public:
    void plot( const Cat& c ) @{ ... @}
    void plot( const Dog& d ) @{ ... @}
    void plot( const Bear& b ) @{ ... @}
    void plot( const Fish& f ) @{ ... @}
@};
@end example

Presumably the PLplot user community can think of even more
imaginative uses... :-).

@node Status of the C++ Interface, , Specializing the PLplot C++ Interface, A C++ Interface for PLplot
@section Status of the C++ Interface

The class @samp{plstream} (and the other abstraction classes in
@file{plstream.h}) provided in PLplot 4.99j (alpha) are to be
considered as works in progress. By the standards outlined above, the
work has barely begun. At this time, @samp{plstream} is mostly a one
to one mirror of the C API, which is to say, it is still far from the
goals of simplification and abstraction outlined above. As such, it
can be expected to change radically over the course of time. (We
don't quote schedules--how long have you been waiting for 5.0? :-).

In any event, we would welcome improvement submissions along the lines
of those above, but we would strongly discourage people from using
@samp{plstream} if they are expecting it to be rock solid. It
@i{will}
be changing, to become more like the design goals elucidated above.

So, if you like the ideas described above, and are willing to accept
the burden of "upgrading" your code as the class @samp{plstream}
evolves, then feel free to use it. Just don't whine when I fix some
of the methods to take references instead of pointers, when I
eliminate some of the redundant methods to use the collapsed form,
etc.

@node Using PLplot from Tcl, Building an Extended WISH, A C++ Interface for PLplot, Top
@chapter Using PLplot from Tcl

PLplot has historically had C and Fortran language bindings. PLplot
version 5.0 introduces a plethora of new programming options including
C++ (described earlier) and several script language bindings. The Tcl
interface to PLplot (which the PLplot maintainers regard as the
primary script language binding) is described in this chapter,
with further discussion of Tcl related issues following in additional
chapters. But Tcl is certainly not the only script language option.
Bindings to Perl, Python, and Scheme (which is actually another
compiled language, but still has some of the flavor of a VHLL) are in
various stages of completion, and are described in separate chapters.
Use the one that suits you best--or try them all!

@section Motivation for the Tcl Interface to PLplot

The recent emergence of several high quality VHLL script languages
such as Tcl, Perl, Python and arguably even some Lisp variants, is
having a profound effect upon the art of computer programming. Tasks
which have traditionally been handled by C or Fortran, are beginning
to be seen in a new light. With relatively fast processors now widely
available, many programming jobs are no longer bound by execution
time, but by human time. Rapidity of initial development and
continued maintenance, for a surprisingly wide class of applications,
is far more important than execution time. Result: in a very short
period of time, say from 1993 to 1995, script languages have exploded
onto the scene, becoming essential tools for any serious programmer.

Moreover, the entire concept of speed of execution needs revising
in the face of the gains made in computer hardware in recent years.
Saying that script language processing is slower than compiled
language processing may be undeniable and simultaneously irrelevant.
If the script language processing is fast enough, then it is fast
enough. Increasingly, computational researchers are finding that
script based tools are indeed fast enough. And if their run time is
fast enough, and their development and maintenance time is much much
better, then why indeed should they not be used?

Even in a field with several high visibility players, Tcl has
distinguished itself as a leading contender. There are many reasons
for this, but perhaps the most important, at least as it relates to
the PLplot user community, is that Tcl was designed to be extensible
and embeddable. The whole purpose of Tcl, as it name (Tool Command
Language) indicates, is to be a command language for other tools. In
other words, the fact that Tcl is capable of being a standalone shell
is interesting, even useful, but nonetheless incidental. The real
attraction of Tcl is that it can be the shell language for
@i{your}
code. Tcl can easily be embedded into your code, endowing it
immediately with a full featured, consistent and well documented
script programming language, providing all the core features you need
in a programming language: variables, procedures, control structures,
error trapping and recovery, tracing, etc. But that is only the
beginning! After that, you can easily extend Tcl by adding commands
to the core language, which invoke the capabilities of your tool. It
is in this sense that Tcl is a tool command language. It is a command
language which you can augment to provide access to the facilities of
your tool.

But Tcl is more than just an embeddable, extensible script language
for personal use. Tcl is an industry, an internet phenomenon. There
are currently at least two high quality books, with more on the way.
There is an industry of service providers and educators. Furthermore,
literally hundreds of Tcl extensions exist, and are readily available
over the net. Perhaps the most notable extension, Tk, provides a
fantastic interface to X Windows widget programming, permitting the
construction of Motif like user interfaces, with none of the hassles
of actually using Motif. Some of these extensions endow Tcl with
object oriented facilities philosophically similar to C++ or other
object oriented languages. Other extensions provide script level
access to system services. Others provide a script interface to
sockets, RPC, and other network programming protocols. The list goes
on and on. Dive into the Tcl archive, and see what it has for you!

So, the answer to the question Why do we want a Tcl interface to
PLplot? is very simple. Because we we are using Tcl anyway, as
the command language for our project, and would like to be able to do
plotting in the command language just as we do so many other things.

But there is more than just the aesthetics of integration to consider.
There are also significant pragmatic considerations. If you generate
your PLplot output via function calls from a compiled language, then
in order to add new diagnostics to your code, or to refine or
embellish existing ones, you have to edit the source, recompile,
relink, and rerun the code. If many iterations are required to get
the plot right, significant time can be wasted. This can be
especially true in the case of C++ code making heavy use of templates,
for which many C++ compilers will have program link times measured in
minutes rather than seconds, even for trivial program changes.

In contrast, if the diagnostic plot is generated from Tcl, the
development cycle looks more like: start the shell (command line or
windowing), source a Tcl script, issue the command to generate the
plot, notice a bug, edit the Tcl script, resource the script, and
regenerate the plot. Notice that compiling, linking, and restarting
the program, have all been dropped from the development cycle. The
time savings from such a development cycle can be amazing!

@node Overview of the Tcl Language Binding, The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension, Motivation for the Tcl Interface to PLplot, Using PLplot from Tcl
@section Overview of the Tcl Language Binding

Each of the PLplot calls available to the C or Fortran programmer are
also available from Tcl, with the same name and generally the same
arguments. Thus for instance, whereas in C you can write:

@example

plenv( 0., 1., 0., 1., 0, 0 );
pllab( "(x)", "(y)", "The title of the graph" );
@end example

you can now write in Tcl:

@example

plenv 0 1 0 1 0 0
pllab "(x)" "(y)" "The title of the graph"
@end example

All the normal Tcl rules apply, there is nothing special about the
PLplot extension commands. So, you could write the above as:

@example

set xmin 0; set xmax 1; set ymin 0; set ymax 1
set just 0; set axis 0
set xlab (x)
set ylab (y)
set title "The title of the graph"
plenv $xmin $xmax $ymin $ymax $just $axis
pllab $xlab $ylab $title
@end example

for example. Not that there is any reason to be loquacious for its
own sake, of course. The point is that you might have things like the
plot bounds or axis labels stored in Tcl variables for some other
reason (tied to a Tk entry widget maybe, or provided as the result of
one of your application specific Tcl extension commands, etc), and
just want to use standard Tcl substitution to make the PLplot calls.

Go ahead and try it! Enter @samp{pltcl} to start up the PLplot
extended Tcl shell, and type (or paste) in the commands. Or put them
in a file and source it. By this point it should be clear how
incredibly easy it is to use the PLplot Tcl language binding.

In order to accommodate the ubiquitous requirement for matrix oriented
data in scientific applications, and in the PLplot API in particular,
PLplot 5.0 includes a Tcl extension for manipulating matrices in Tcl.
This Tcl Matrix Extension provides a straightforward and direct means
of representing one and two dimensional matrices in Tcl. The Tcl
Matrix Extension is described in detail in the next section, but we
mention its existence now just so that we can show how the PLplot Tcl
API works. Many of the PLplot Tcl API functions accept Tcl matrices
as arguments. For instance, in C you might write:

@example

float x[100], y[100];

/* code to initialize x and y */

plline( 100, x, y );
@end example

In Tcl you can write:

@example

matrix x f 100
matrix y f 100

# code to initialize x and y

plline 100 x y
@end example

Some of the PLplot C function calls use pointer arguments to allow
retrieval of PLplot settings. These are implemented in Tcl by
changing the value of the variable whose name you provide. For
example:

@example

pltcl> plgxax
wrong # args: should be "plgxax digmax digits  "
pltcl> set digmax 0
0
pltcl> set digits 0
0
pltcl> plgxax digmax digits
pltcl> puts "digmax=$digmax digits=$digits"
digmax=4 digits=0
@end example

This example shows that each PLplot Tcl command is designed to issue
an error if you invoke it incorrectly, which in this case was used to
remind us of the correct arguments. We then create two Tcl variables
to hold the results. Then we invoke the PLplot @samp{plgxax} function
to obtain the label formatting information for the x axis. And
finally we print the results.

People familiar with Tcl culture may wonder why the @samp{plg*} series
functions don't just pack their results into the standard Tcl result
string. The reason is that the user would then have to extract the
desired field with either @samp{lindex} or
@samp{regexp}, which seems
messy. So instead, we designed the PLplot Tcl API to look and feel as
much like the C API as could reasonably be managed.

In general then, you can assume that each C function is provided in
Tcl with the same name and same arguments (and one or two dimensional
arrays in C are replaced by Tcl matrices). There are only a few
exceptions to this rule, generally resulting from the complexity of
the argument types which are passed to some functions in the C API.
Those exceptional functions are described below, all others work in
the obvious way (analogous to the examples above). 

See the Tcl example programs for extensive demonstrations of the usage
of the PLplot Tcl API. To run the Tcl demos:

@example

% pltcl
pltcl> source tcldemos.tcl
pltcl> 1
pltcl> 2
@end example

Alternatively, you can run @samp{plserver} and source
@file{tkdemos.tcl}.

In any event, the Tcl demos provide very good coverage of the Tcl API,
and consequently serve as excellent examples of usage. For the most
part they draw the same plots as their C counterpart. Moreover, many
of them were constructed by literally inserting the C code into the
Tcl source file, and performing fairly mechanical transformations on
the source. This should provide encouragement to anyone used to using
PLplot through one of the compiled interfaces, that they can easily
and rapidly become productive with PLplot in Tcl.

@node The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension, Contouring and Shading from Tcl, Overview of the Tcl Language Binding, Using PLplot from Tcl
@section The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension

Tcl does many things well, but handling collections of numbers is not
one of them. You could make lists, but for data sets of sizes
relevant to scientific graphics which is the primary domain of
applicability for PLplot, the extraction time is excessive and
burdensome. You could use Tcl arrays, but the storage overhead is
astronomical and the lookup time, while better than list manipulation,
is still prohibitive. 

To cope with this, a Tcl Matrix extension was created for the
purpose of making it feasible to work with large collections of
numbers in Tcl, in a way which is storage efficient, reasonably 
efficient for accesses from Tcl, and reasonably compatible with
practices used in compiled code.

@node Using Tcl Matrices from Tcl, Using Tcl Matrices from C, , The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension
@subsection Using Tcl Matrices from Tcl

Much like the Tk widget creation commands, the Tcl @samp{matrix}
command considers its first argument to be the name of a new command
to be created, and the rest of the arguments to be modifiers. After
the name, the next argument can be @samp{float} or
@samp{int} or
contractions thereof. Next follow a variable number of size arguments
which determine the size of the matrix in each of its dimensions. For
example: 

@example

matrix x f 100
matrix y i 64 64
@end example

constructs two matrices. @samp{x} is a float matrix, with one
dimension and 100 elements. @samp{y} is an integer matrix, and has 2
dimensions each of size 64.

Additionally, an initializer may be specified, with a syntax familiar
from C. For example:

@example

matrix x f 4 = @{ 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 @}
@end example

A Tcl matrix is a command, and as longtime Tcl users know, Tcl
commands are globally accessible. The PLplot Tcl Matrix extension
attempts to lessen the impact of this by registering a variable in the
local scope, and tracing it for insets, and deleting the actual
matrix command when the variable goes out of scope. In this way, a
Tcl matrix appears to work sort of like a variable. It is, however,
just an illusion, so you have to keep this in mind. In particular,
you may want the matrix to outlive the scope in which it was created.
For example, you may want to create a matrix, load it with data, and
then pass it off to a Tk megawidget for display in a spreadsheet like
form. The proc which launches the Tk megawidget will complete, but
the megawidget, and the associated Tcl matrix are supposed to hang
around until they are explicitly destroyed. To achieve this effect,
create the Tcl matrix with the @samp{-persist} flag. If present
(can be anywhere on the line), the matrix is not automatically deleted
when the scope of the current proc (method) ends. Instead, you must
explicitly clean up by using either the 'delete' matrix command or renaming
the matrix command name to @{@}. Now works correctly from within [incr Tcl].

As mentioned above, the result of creating a matrix is that a new
command of the given name is added to the interpreter. You can then
evaluate the command, providing indices as arguments, to extract the
data. For example:

@example

pltcl> matrix x f = @{1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5@}
insufficient dimensions given for Matrix operator "x"
pltcl> matrix x f 4 = @{1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5@}
pltcl> x 0
1.500000
pltcl> x 1
2.500000
pltcl> x 3
4.500000
pltcl> x *
1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000
pltcl> puts "x\[1\]=[x 1]"
x[1]=2.500000
pltcl> puts "x\[*\] = :[x *]:"
x[*] = :1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000:
pltcl> foreach v [x *] @{ puts $v @}
1.500000
2.500000
3.500000
4.500000
pltcl> for @{set i 0@} @{$i < 4@} @{incr i@} @{
           if @{[x $i] < 3@} @{puts [x $i]@} @}
1.500000
2.500000
@end example

Note from the above that the output of evaluating a matrix indexing
operation is suitable for use in condition processing, list
processing, etc.

You can assign to matrix locations in a similar way:

@example

pltcl> x 2 = 7
pltcl> puts ":[x *]:"
:1.500000 2.500000 7.000000 4.500000:
pltcl> x * = 3
pltcl> puts ":[x *]:"
@end example

Note that the * provides a means of obtaining an index range, and that
it must be separated from the = by a space. Future versions of the
Tcl Matrix extension may allow alternative ways of specifying index
ranges and may assign the obvious meaning to an expression of the
form:

@example

x *= 3
@end example

However this has not been implemented yet...

In any event, the @samp{matrix} command also supports an
@samp{info}
subcommand which reports the number of elements in each dimension:

@example

pltcl> x info
4 
pltcl> matrix y i 8 10
pltcl> y info
8 10 
@end example

@node Using Tcl Matrices from C, Using Tcl Matrices from C++, Using Tcl Matrices from Tcl, The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension
@subsection Using Tcl Matrices from C

Normally you will create a matrix in Tcl, and then want to pass it to
C in order to have the data filled in, or existing data to be used in
a computation, etc. To do this, pass the name of the matrix command
as an argument to your C Tcl command procedure. The C code should
include @file{tclMatrix.h}, which has a definition for the
@samp{tclMatrix} structure. You fetch a pointer to the
@samp{tclMatrix} structure using the
@samp{Tcl_GetMatrixPtr} function.

For example, in Tcl:

@example

matrix x f 100
wacky x
@end example

and in C:

@example

int wackyCmd( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp,
              int argc, char *argv[] )
@{
    tclMatrix *w;

    w = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
    ...
@end example

To learn about what else you can do with the matrix once inside
compiled code, read @file{tclMatrix.h} to learn the definition of the
@samp{tclMatrix} structure, and see the examples in files like
@file{tclAPI.c} which show many various uses of the Tcl matrix.

@node Using Tcl Matrices from C++, Extending the Tcl Matrix facility, Using Tcl Matrices from C, The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension
@subsection Using Tcl Matrices from C++

Using a Tcl matrix from C++ is very much like using it from C, except
that @file{tclMatrix.h} contains some C++ wrapper classes which are
somewhat more convenient than using the indexing macros which one has
to use in C. For example, here is a tiny snippet from one of the
authors codes in which Tcl matrices are passed in from Tcl to a C++
routine which is supposed to fill them in with values from some
matrices used in the compiled side of the code:

@example

...
if (item == "vertex_coords") @{
    tclMatrix *matxg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
    tclMatrix *matyg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[2] );

    Mat2<float> xg(ncu, ncv), yg(ncu, ncv);
    cg->Get_Vertex_Coords( xg, yg );

    TclMatFloat txg( matxg ), tyg( matyg );

    for( i=0; i < ncu; i++ )
        for( j=0; j < ncv; j++ ) @{
            txg(i,j) = xg(i,j);
            tyg(i,j) = yg(i,j);
        @}
@end example

There are other things you can do too, see the definitions of the
@samp{TclMatFloat} and @samp{TclMatInt} classes in
@file{tclMatrix.h}. 

@node Extending the Tcl Matrix facility, , Using Tcl Matrices from C++, The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension
@subsection Extending the Tcl Matrix facility

The Tcl matrix facility provides creation, indexing, and information
gathering facilities. However, considering the scientifically
inclined PLplot user base, it is clear that some users will demand
more. Consequently there is a mechanism for augmenting the Tcl matrix
facility with your own, user defined, extension subcommands. Consider
@file{xtk04.c}. In this extended wish, we want to be able to
determine the minimum and maximum values stored in a matrix. Doing
this in Tcl would involve nested loops, which in Tcl would be
prohibitively slow. We could register a Tcl extension command to do
it, but since the only sensible data for such a command would be a
Tcl matrix, it seems nice to provide this facility as an actual
subcommand of the matrix. However, the PLplot maintainers cannot
foresee every need, so a mechanism is provided to register subcommands
for use with matrix objects.

The way to register matrix extension subcommands is to call
@samp{Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn}: 

@example

typedef int (*tclMatrixXtnsnProc) ( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                                    int argc, char *argv[] );

int Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( char *cmd, tclMatrixXtnsnProc proc );
@end example

In other words, make a function for handling the matrix extension
subcommand, with the same function signature (prototype) as
@samp{tclMatrixXtnsnProc}, and register the subcommand name along with
the function pointer. For example, xtk04.c has:

@example

int mat_max( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
             int argc, char *argv[] )
@{
    float max = pm->fdata[0];
    int i;
    for( i=1; i < pm->len; i++ )
        if (pm->fdata[i] > max)
            max = pm->fdata[i];

    sprintf( interp->result, "%f", max );
    return TCL_OK;
@}

int mat_min( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
             int argc, char *argv[] )
@{
    float min = pm->fdata[0];
    int i;
    for( i=1; i < pm->len; i++ )
        if (pm->fdata[i] < min)
            min = pm->fdata[i];

    sprintf( interp->result, "%f", min );
    return TCL_OK;
@}
@end example

Then, inside the application initialization function
(@samp{Tcl_AppInit()} to long time Tcl users):

@example

Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "max", mat_max );
Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "min", mat_min );
@end example

Then we can do things like:

@example

dino 65: xtk04

@node Contouring and Shading from Tcl, Understanding the Performance Characteristics of Tcl, The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension, Using PLplot from Tcl
@section Contouring and Shading from Tcl

Contouring and shading has traditionally been one of the
messier things to do in PLplot. The C API has many parameters, with
complex setup and tear down properties. Of special concern is that
some of the parameters do not have a natural representation in script
languages like Tcl. In this section we describe how the Tcl
interface to these facilities is provided, and how to use it.

@menu
* Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl::
* Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl::
@end menu

@node Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl, Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl, , Contouring and Shading from Tcl
@subsection Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl

By way of reference, the primary C function call for contouring is:

@example

void plcont( PLFLT **f, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLINT kx, PLINT lx,
             PLINT ky, PLINT ly, PLFLT *clevel, PLINT nlevel,
             void (*pltr) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer),
             PLPointer pltr_data);
@end example


This is a fairly complex argument list, and so for this function (and
for plshade, described below) we dispense with trying to exactly
mirror the C API, and just concentrate on capturing the functionality
within a Tcl context. To begin with, the data is provided through a
2-d Tcl matrix. The Tcl matrix carries along its size information
with it, so @samp{nx} and @samp{ny} are no longer needed. The
@samp{kx}, @samp{lx}, @samp{ky} and
@samp{ly} variables are
potentially still useful for plotting a subdomain of the full data
set, so they may be specified in the natural way, but we make this
optional since they are frequently not used to convey anything more
than what could be inferred from @samp{nx} and
@samp{ny}. However, to
simplify processing, they must be supplied or omitted as a set (all of
them, or none of them). @samp{clevel} is supplied as a 1-d Tcl
matrix, and so @samp{nlevel} can be omitted. 

Finally, we have no way to support function pointers from Tcl, so
instead we provide token based support for accessing the three
coordinate transformation routines which are provided by PLplot, and
which many PLplot users use. There are thus three courses of action:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Provide no pltr specification. In this case, @samp{pltr0} is
used by default.

@item
Specify @samp{pltr1 x y} where x and y are 1-d Tcl matrices.
In this case @samp{pltr1} will be used, and the 1-d arrays which it
needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices @samp{x} and
@samp{y}.

@item
Specify @samp{pltr2 x y} where x and y are 2-d Tcl matrices.
In this case @samp{pltr2} will be used, and the 2-d arrays which it
needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices @samp{x} and
@samp{y}.
@end itemize

Now, there can be no question that this is both more concise and less
powerful than what you could get in C. The loss of the ability to
provide a user specified transformation function is regrettable. If
you really do need that functionality, you will have to implement your
own Tcl extension command to do pretty much the same thing as the
provided Tcl extension command @samp{plcont} (which is in
@file{tclAPI.c} in function @samp{plcontCmd()}), except specify the C
transformation function of your choice.

However, that having been said, we recognize that one common use for
this capability is to provide a special version of @samp{pltr2} which
knows how to implement a periodic boundary condition, so that polar
plots, for example, can be implemented cleanly. That is, if you want
to draw contours of a polar data set defined on a 64 x 64 grid,
ensuring that contour lines would actually go all the way around the
origin rather than breaking off like a silly pacman figure, then you
had basically two choices in C. You could copy the data to a 65 x 64
grid, and replicate one row of data into the spare slot, and then plot
the larger data set (taking care to replicate the coordinate arrays
you passed to pltr2 in the same way), @i{or} you could make a
special version of @samp{pltr2} which would understand that one of the
coordinates was wrapped, and perform transformations accordingly
without actually making you replicate the data.

Since the former option is ugly in general, and hard to do in Tcl in
particular, and since the second option is even more difficult to do
in Tcl (requiring you do make a special Tcl extension command as
described above), we provide special, explicit support for this common
activity. This is provided through the use of a new, optional
parameter @samp{wrap} which may be specified as the last parameter to
the Tcl command, only if you are using @samp{pltr2}. Supplying
@samp{1} will wrap in the first coordinate, @samp{2} will wrap in the
second coordinate.

The resultant Tcl command is:

@example

plcont f [kx lx ky ly] clev [pltr x y] [wrap]
@end example

Note that the brackets here are used to signify optional arguments,
@i{not} to represent Tcl command substitution!

The Tcl demo @file{x09.tcl} provides examples of all the capabilities
of this interface to contouring from Tcl. Note in particular,
@samp{x09_polar} which does a polar contour without doing anything
complicated in the way of setup, and without getting a pacman as the
output. 

@node Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl, , Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl, Contouring and Shading from Tcl
@subsection Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl

The Tcl interface to shading works very much like the one for
contouring. The command is:

@example

plshade z xmin xmax ymin ymax \
    sh_min sh_max sh_cmap sh_color sh_width \
    min_col min_wid max_col max_wid \
    rect [pltr x y] [wrap]
@end example

where @samp{nx} and @samp{ny} were dropped since they are inferred
from the Tcl matrix @samp{z}, @samp{defined} was dropped since it
isn't supported anyway, and @samp{plfill} was dropped since it was the
only valid choice anyway. The @samp{pltr} spec and
@samp{wrap} work
exactly as described for the Tcl @samp{plcont} described above.

The Tcl demo @file{x16.tcl} contains extensive demonstrations of use,
including a shaded polar plot which connects in the desirable way
without requiring special data preparation, again just like for
@samp{plcont} described previously.

@node Understanding the Performance Characteristics of Tcl, , Contouring and Shading from Tcl, Using PLplot from Tcl
@section Understanding the Performance Characteristics of Tcl

Newcomers to Tcl, and detractors (read, proponents of other
paradigms) often do not have a clear (newcomers) or truthful
(detractors) perspective on Tcl performance. In this section we try
to convey a little orientation which may be helpful in working with
the PLplot Tcl interface.

Tcl is slow! Yeah, so what?

Debates of this form frequently completely miss the point. Yes, Tcl
is definitely slow. It is fundamentally a string processing language,
is interpreted, and must perform substitutions and so forth on a
continual basis. All of that takes time. Think milliseconds instead
of microseconds for comparing Tcl code to equivalent C code. On the
other hand, this does not have to be problematic, even for time
critical (interactive) applications, if the division of labor is done
correctly. Even in an interactive program, you can use Tcl fairly
extensively for high level control type operations, as long as you do
the real work in a compiled Tcl command procedure. If the high level
control code is slow, so what? So it takes 100 milliseconds over the
life the process, as compared to the 100 microseconds it could have
taken if it were in C. Big deal. On an absolute time scale, measured
in units meaningful to humans, it's just not a lot of time.

The problem comes when you try to do too much in Tcl. For instance,
an interactive process should not be trying to evaluate a
mathematical expression inside a doubly nested loop structure, if
performance is going to be a concern.

Case in point: Compare x16.tcl to x16c.c. The code looks very
similar, and the output looks very similar. What is not so similar is
the execution time. The Tcl code, which sets up the data entirely in
Tcl, takes a while to do so. On the other hand, the actual plotting
of the data proceeds at a rate which is effectively indistinguishable
from that of the compiled example. On human time scales, the
difference is not meaningful. Conclusion: If the computation of the
data arrays could be moved to compiled code, the two programs would
have performance close enough to identical that it really wouldn't be
an issue. We left the Tcl demos coded in Tcl for two reasons. First
because they provide some examples and tests of the use of the Tcl
Matrix extension, and secondly because they allow the Tcl demos to be
coded entirely in Tcl, without requiring special customized extended
shells for each one of them. They are not, however, a good example of
you should do things in practice.

Now look at @file{tk04} and @file{xtk04.c}, you will see
that if the data is computed in compiled code, and shuffled into the
Tcl matrix and then plotted from Tcl, the performance is fine. Almost
all the time is spent in plshade, in compiled code. The time taken to
do the small amount of Tcl processing involved with plotting is
dwarfed by the time spent doing the actual drawing in C. So using Tcl
cost almost nothing in this case.

So, the point is, do your heavy numerics in a compiled language, and
feel free to use Tcl for the plotting, if you want to. You can of
course mix it up so that some plotting is done from Tcl and some from
a compiled language. 

@node Building an Extended WISH, Embedding Plots in Graphical User Interfaces, Using PLplot from Tcl, Top
@chapter Building an Extended WISH

Beginning with PLplot 5.0, a new and powerful paradigm for interaction
with PLplot is introduced. This new paradigm consists of an
integration of PLplot with a powerful scripting language (Tcl), and
extensions to that language to support X Windows interface development
(Tk) and object oriented programming ([incr Tcl]). Taken together,
these four software systems (Tcl/Tk/itcl/PLplot) comprise a powerful
environment for the rapid prototyping and development of sophisticated,
flexible, X Windows applications with access to the PLplot API. Yet
that is only the beginning---Tcl was born to be extended. The true
power of this paradigm is achieved when you add your own, powerful,
application specific extensions to the above quartet, thus creating an
environment for the development of wholly new applications with only a
few keystrokes of shell programming ...

@section Introduction to Tcl

The Tool Command Language, or just Tcl (pronounced
tickle) is an embeddable script language which can be
used to control a wide variety of applications. Designed by John
Ousterhout of UC Berkeley, Tcl is freely available under the standard
Berkeley copyright. Tcl and Tk (described below) are extensively
documented in a new book published by Addison Wesley, entitled
Tcl and the Tk toolkit by John Ousterhout. This book
is a must have for those interested in developing powerful extensible
applications with high quality X Windows user interfaces. The
discussion in this chapter cannot hope to approach the level of
introduction provided by that book. Rather we will concentrate on
trying to convey some of the excitement, and show the nuts and bolts
of using Tcl and some extensions to provide a powerful and flexible
interface to the PLplot library within your application.

@menu
* Motivation for Tcl::
* Capabilities of Tcl::
* Acquiring Tcl::
@end menu

@node Motivation for Tcl, Capabilities of Tcl, , Introduction to Tcl
@subsection Motivation for Tcl

The central observation which led Ousterhout to create Tcl was the
realization that many applications require the use of some sort of
a special purpose, application specific, embedded macro
language. Application programmers cobble these tiny
languages into their codes in order to provide flexibility
and some modicum of high level control. But the end result is
frequently a quirky and fragile language. And each application has
a different tiny language associated with it. The
idea behind Tcl, then, was to create a single core
language which could be easily embedded into a wide variety
of applications. Further, it should be easily extensible so that
individual applications can easily provide application specific
capabilities available in the macro language itself, while still
providing a robust, uniform syntax across a variety of
applications. To say that Tcl satisfies these requirements would
be a spectacular understatement.

@node Capabilities of Tcl, Acquiring Tcl, Motivation for Tcl, Introduction to Tcl
@subsection Capabilities of Tcl

The mechanics of using Tcl are very straightforward. Basically you
just have to include the file @file{tcl.h}, issue
some API calls to create a Tcl interpreter, and then evaluate a
script file or perform other operations supported by the Tcl API.
Then just link against @file{libtcl.a} and off you
go.

Having done this, you have essentially created a shell. That is, your
program can now execute shell scripts in the Tcl language. Tcl
provides support for basic control flow, variable substitution file
i/o and subroutines. In addition to the builtin Tcl commands, you can
define your own subroutines as Tcl procedures which effectively
become new keywords.

But the real power of this approach is to add new commands to the
interpreter which are realized by compiled C code in your
application. Tcl provides a straightforward API call which allows
you to register a function in your code to be called whenever the
interpreter comes across a specific keyword of your choosing in
the shell scripts it executes.

This facility allows you with tremendous ease, to endow your
application with a powerful, robust and full featured macro
language, trivially extend that macro language with new keywords
which trigger execution of compiled application specific commands,
and thereby raise the level of interaction with your code to one of
essentially shell programming via script editing.

@node Acquiring Tcl, , Capabilities of Tcl, Introduction to Tcl
@subsection Acquiring Tcl

There are several important sources of info and code for Tcl.
Definitely get the book mentioned above. The Tcl and Tk toolkits
are distributed by anonymous @code{ftp} at @uref{ftp://sprite.berkeley.edu/tcl,@file{sprite.berkeley.edu:/tcl}}.
There are several files in there corresponding to Tcl, Tk, and
various forms of documentation. At the time of this writing, the
current versions of Tcl and Tk are 7.3 and 3.6 respectively.
Retrieve those files, and install using the instructions provided
therein.

The other major anonymous @code{ftp} site for Tcl is
@uref{ftp://harbor.ecn.purdue.edu/pub/tcl,@file{harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/pub/tcl}}.
Harbor contains a mirror of @samp{sprite} as well as
innumerable extensions, Tcl/Tk packages, tutorials, documentation,
etc. The level of excitement in the Tcl community is
extraordinarily high, and this is reflected by the great plethora
of available, high quality, packages and extensions available for
use with Tcl and Tk. Explore---there is definitely something
for everyone.

Additionally there is a newsgroup, @samp{comp.lang.tcl}
which is well read, and an excellent place for people to get
oriented, find help, etc. Highly recommended.

In any event, in order to use the Tk driver in PLplot, you will
need Tcl-8.2 and Tk-8.2 (or higher versions). Additionally, in order
to use the extended WISH paradigm (described below) you will need
iTcl-3.1 (or a higher version).

However, you will quite likely find Tcl/Tk to be very addictive,
and the great plethora of add-ons available at
@samp{harbor} will undoubtedly attract no small amount
of your attention. It has been our experience that all of these
extensions fit together very well. You will find that there are
large sectors of the Tcl user community which create so-called
MegaWishes which combine many of the available
extensions into a single, heavily embellished, shell interpreter.
The benefits of this approach will become apparent as you gain
experience with Tcl and Tk.

@node Introduction to Tk, Introduction to [incr Tcl], Introduction to Tcl, Building an Extended WISH
@section Introduction to Tk

As mentioned above, Tcl is designed to be extensible. The first and
most basic Tcl extension is Tk, an X11 toolkit. Tk provides the same
basic facilities that you may be familiar with from other X11
toolkits such as Athena and Motif, except that they are provided in
the context of the Tcl language. There are C bindings too, but these
are seldom needed---the vast majority of useful Tk applications
can be coded using Tcl scripts.

If it has not become obvious already, it is worth noting at this
point that Tcl is one example of a family of languages known
generally as Very High Level Languages, or VHLL's.
Essentially a VHLL raises the level of programming to a very high
level, allowing very short token streams to accomplish as much as
would be required by many scores of the more primitive actions
available in a basic HLL. Consider, for example, the basic
Hello World! application written in Tcl/Tk.


@example

#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

button .hello -text "Hello World!"  -command "destroy ."
pack .hello
@end example

That's it! That's all there is to it. If you have ever programmed X
using a traditional toolkit such as Athena or Motif, you can
appreciate how amazingly much more convenient this is. If not, you
can either take our word for it that this is 20 times less code than
you would need to use a standard toolkit, or you can go write the
same program in one of the usual toolkits and see for yourself...

We cannot hope to provide a thorough introduction to Tk programming
in this section. Instead, we will just say that immensely complex
applications can be constructed merely by programming in exactly the
way shown in the above script. By writing more complex scripts, and
by utilizing the additional widgets provided by Tk, one can create
beautiful, extensive user interfaces. Moreover, this can be done in
a tiny fraction of the time it takes to do the same work in a
conventional toolkit. Literally minutes versus days.

Tk provides widgets for labels, buttons, radio buttons, frames with
or without borders, menubars, pull downs, toplevels, canvases, edit
boxes, scroll bars, etc.

A look at the interface provided by the PLplot Tk driver
should help give you a better idea of what you can do with this
paradigm. Also check out some of the contributed Tcl/Tk packages
available at harbor. There are high quality Tk interfaces to a great
many familiar Unix utilities ranging from mail to info, to SQL, to
news, etc. The list is endless and growing fast...

@node Introduction to [incr Tcl], PLplot Extensions to Tcl, Introduction to Tk, Building an Extended WISH
@section Introduction to [incr Tcl]

Another extremely powerful and popular extension to Tcl is [incr
Tcl]. [incr Tcl] is to Tcl what C++ is to C. The analogy is very
extensive. Itcl provides an object oriented extension to Tcl
supporting clustering of procedures and data into what is called an
@samp{itcl_class}. An @samp{itcl_class} can
have methods as well as instance data. And they support inheritance.
Essentially if you know how C++ relates to C, and if you know Tcl,
then you understand the programming model provided by Itcl.

In particular, you can use Itcl to implement new widgets which are
composed of more basic Tk widgets. A file selector is an example.
Using Tk, one can build up a very nice file selector comprised of
more basic Tk widgets such as entries, listboxes, scrollbars, etc.

But what if you need two file selectors? You have to do it all
again. Or what if you need two different kinds of file selectors,
you get to do it again and add some incremental code.

This is exactly the sort of thing object orientation is intended to
assist. Using Itcl you can create an @samp{itcl_class
FileSelector} and then you can instantiate them freely as
easily as:


@example

    FileSelector .fs1
    .fs1 -dir . -find "*.cc"
@end example

and so forth.

These high level widgets composed of smaller Tk widgets, are known as
megawidgets. There is a developing subculture of the
Tcl/Tk community for designing and implementing megawidgets, and
[incr Tcl] is the most popular enabling technology.

In particular, it is the enabling technology which is employed for
the construction of the PLplot Tcl extensions, described below.

@node PLplot Extensions to Tcl, Custom Extensions to Tcl, Introduction to [incr Tcl], Building an Extended WISH
@section PLplot Extensions to Tcl

Following the paradigm described above, PLplot provides extensions to
Tcl as well, designed to allow the use of PLplot from Tcl/Tk
programs. Essentially the idea here is to allow PLplot programmers
to achieve two goals:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
To access PLplot facilities from their own extended WISH and/or
Tcl/Tk user interface scripts.

@item
To have PLplot display its output in a window integrated
directly into the rest of their Tcl/Tk interface.
@end itemize

For instance, prior to PLplot 5.0, if a programmer wanted to use
PLplot in a Tcl/Tk application, the best he could manage was to call
the PLplot C API from compiled C code, and get the output via the
Xwin driver, which would display in it's own toplevel window. In
other words, there was no integration, and the result was pretty
sloppy.

With PLplot 5.0, there is now a supported Tcl interface to PLplot
functionality. This is provided through a family of
PLplot megawidgets implemented in [incr Tcl]. Using this interface,
a programmer can get a PLplot window/widget into a Tk interface as
easily as:


@example

PLWin .plw
pack .plw
@end example

Actually, there's the update/init business---need to clear that up.

The @samp{PLWin} class then mirrors much of the PLplot C
API, so that a user can generate plots in the PLplot widget entirely
from Tcl. This is demonstrated in the @file{tk02}
demo,

@node Custom Extensions to Tcl, , PLplot Extensions to Tcl, Building an Extended WISH
@section Custom Extensions to Tcl

By this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of the
underlying philosophy of Tcl and Tk, and the whole concept of
extensions, of which [incr Tcl] and PLplot are examples. These alone
are enough to allow the rapid prototyping and development of
powerful, flexible graphical applications. Normally the programmer
simply writes a shell script to be executed by the Tk windowing
shell, @code{wish}. It is in vogue for each Tcl/Tk
extension package to build it's own extended WISH.
There are many examples of this, and indeed even PLplot's
@code{plserver} program, described in an earlier chapter,
could just as easily have been called @code{plwish}.

In any event, as exciting and useful as these standalone, extended
windowing shells may be, they are ultimately only the beginning of
what you can do. The real benefit of this approach is realized when
you make your own extended WISH, comprised of Tcl, Tk,
any of the standard extensions you like, and finally embellished with
a smattering of application specific extensions designed to support
your own application domain. In this section we give a detailed
introduction to the process of constructing your own WISH. After
that, you're on your own...

@menu

@node WISH Construction, WISH Linking, , Custom Extensions to Tcl
@subsection WISH Construction

The standard way to make your own WISH, as supported by the Tcl/Tk
system, is to take a boilerplate file,
@file{tkAppInit.c}, edit to reflect the Tcl/Tk
extensions you will be requiring, add some commands to the
interpreter, and link it all together.

Here for example is the important part of the
@file{tk02} demo, extracted from the file
@file{xtk02.c}, which is effectively the extended
WISH definition file for the @file{tk02} demo.
Comments and other miscellany are omitted.


@example

#include "tk.h"
#include "itcl.h"

     * they weren't already created by the init procedures called above.
     */

    Tcl_CreateCommand(interp, "myplot", myplotCmd,
                      (ClientData) main, (void (*)(ClientData)) NULL);


    /*

     * file is "~/.apprc" where "app" is the name of the application.

     */

    tcl_RcFileName = "~/.wishrc";
    return TCL_OK;
@}

/* ... myPlotCmd, etc ... */
@end example

The calls to @samp{Tcl_Init()} and
@samp{Tk_Init()} are in every WISH. To make an
extended WISH, you add calls to the initialization routines for any
extension packages you want to use, in this [incr Tcl]
(@samp{Itcl_Init()}) and PLplot
(@samp{Pltk_Init()}). Finally you add keywords to the
interpreter, associating them with functions in your code using
@samp{Tcl_CreateCommand()} as shown.

In particular, PLplot has a number of [incr Tcl] classes in its Tcl
library. If you want to be able to use those in your WISH, you
need to include the initialization of [incr Tcl].

@node WISH Linking, WISH Programming, WISH Construction, Custom Extensions to Tcl
@subsection WISH Linking

Having constructed your @samp{Tcl_AppInit()} function,
you now merely need to link this file with your own private files
to provide the code for any functions you registered via
@samp{Tcl_CreateCommand()} (and any they depend on),
against the Tcl, Tk and extension libraries you are using.


@example

cc -c tkAppInit.c
cc -c mycommands.c
cc -o my_wish tkAppInit.o mycommands.o 
           -lplplotftk -ltcl -ltk -litcl -lX11 -lm
@end example

Add any needed @samp{-L} options as needed.

Voila! You have made a wish.

@node WISH Programming, , WISH Linking, Custom Extensions to Tcl
@subsection WISH Programming

Now you are ready to put the genie to work. The basic plan here is
to write shell scripts which use your new application specific
windowing shell as their interpreter, to implement X Windows user
interfaces to control and utilize the facilities made available in
your extensions.

Effectively this just comes down to writing Tcl/Tk code, embellished
as appropriate with calls to the extension commands you registered.
Additionally, since this wish includes the PLplot extensions, you
can instantiate any of the PLplot family of [incr Tcl] classes, and
invoke methods on those objects to effect the drawing of graphs.
Similarly, you may have your extension commands (which are coded in
C) call the PLplot C programmers API to draw into the widget. In
this way you can have the best of both worlds. Use compiled C code
when the computational demands require the speed of compiled code,
or use Tcl when your programming convenience is more important than
raw speed.

A specialized API is provided for PlplotCanvas and is described in
@ref{PlplotCanvas API,,PlplotCanvas API}.. The API provides methods
to create and manipulate PlplotCanvas widgets, in addition to
object-oriented analogues for each of the PLplot functions.

Example programs are provided that demonstrate the use of the 
PlplotCanvas widget in @ref{PlplotCanvas Examples,,PlplotCanvas Examples}..

@subsection PlplotCanvas API

The PlplotCanvas methods are as follows. Because PlplotCanvas is a
GTK widget, GLib types (gint, gdouble, gboolean, etc) are sometimes 
used rather than PLplot types (PLINT, PLFLT, etc). See 
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/index.html for more 
information on GLib and GLib types.

The PLplot functions have analogue methods named like
@code{plplot_canvas_plfunc}. For example, the 
PLplot function @code{plline} (@pxref{plline; Draw a line}) maps to 
@code{plplot_canvas_plline}. The 
@code{plplot_canvas_plfunc} methods
should be used rather than the standard PLplot API when the
PlplotCanvas is used.

Lines drawn to the canvas are not shown until the page is
advanced using @code{plplot_canvas_pladv}. The 
plot will remain on the canvas until the next page advance.

The PLplot @code{plinit} (@pxref{plinit; Initialize PLplot}) and @code{plgstrm} (@pxref{plgstrm; Get current stream number}) functions are not used with 
PlplotCanvas because the @code{plplot_canvas_new}
function does the necessary initialization and returns an 
object with a unique stream number.

#include <plplotcanvas.h>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

  gtk_init(&argc, &argv);
  g_type_init();

  /* Create the canvas and set its size; during the creation process,

   */
  canvas=plplot_canvas_new(TRUE);
  plplot_canvas_set_size(canvas,WIDTH,HEIGHT);

  /* Create a new window and stuff the canvas into it */
  window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

  /* Advancing the page finalizes this plot */
  plplot_canvas_pladv(canvas,0);

  /* Start the gtk main loop */
  gtk_main();
@}
@end example

So, what's going on here? After the preliminaries, the GTK and the 
GLib type system are initialized by calls to 
@code{gtk_init} and @code{g_type_init}. 
A PlplotCanvas is created using 
@code{plplot_canvas_new}, and it's size is set using 
@code{plplot_canvas_set_size}. 

Next, a window is created (@code{gtk_window_new}), 
the border is set (@code{gtk_set_border_width}), 
and the canvas is stuffed into the window 
(@code{gtk_container_add}). 

Callback functions are installed using 
@code{g_signal_connect} so that the window 
decorations respond. The window is set to display everything using
@code{gtk_widget_show_all}.

Now come the PLplot analogue commands. First, the page using is
advanced using @code{plplot_canvas_pladv}. The pen 
color and width are set with @code{plplot_canvas_plcol0} 
and @code{plplot_canvas_plwid},respectively. The PLplot
viewport, window, box and labels are created using 
@code{plplot_canvas_plvpor}, 
@code{plplot_canvas_plwind}, 
@code{plplot_canvas_plbox} and 
@code{plplot_canvas_pllab}, respectively. A line is 
drawn on the canvas using @code{plplot_canvas_plline}, 
the page is advanced with @code{plplot_canvas_pladv}.

Finally, the GTK main loop is entered using 
@code{gtk_main}, where it resides until the program
is exited.

@node Using PLplot from Perl, Using PLplot from Python, Embedding Plots in Graphical User Interfaces, Top
@chapter Using PLplot from Perl

There are no proper bindings for the Perl language delivered with the
PLplot sources. However, a PLplot interface has been added to the Perl
Data Language (PDL) since version 2.4.0. If the PLplot library is
installed in the system, it is automatically detected by the PDL
configuration script, such that PLplot support for PDL should work out
of the box. For further information see the @uref{http://pdl.perl.org,PDL homepage}.

The PDL PLplot interface (PDL::Graphics::PLplot) can interact with
PLplot in two ways: (1) A low level mapping one to one mapping of
perl functions to PLplot API functions and (2) A high level object
oriented wrapper that simplifies generating 2D plots. The PLplot
source distribution contains multiple examples of how to use the
low level interface (see examples/perl). A key thing to note is
that, due to the architecture of PDL, all the array arguments to
a function come first, followed by the scalars. This means that
the argument order for some of the functions in the PLplot API
is different when called from PDL.

Here is an usage example comparing the low level and the
object oriented interfaces to PLplot.


@example

use PDL;
use PDL::Graphics::PLplot;

my $x = pdl (0..5);
my $y = $x ** 2;

# low level interface

plsdev ("xwin");
plinit ();
plcol0 (1);

plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
plline ($x, $y);

plend ();

# OO interface

my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new (DEV => "xwin", );
$pl->xyplot($x, $y, TITLE => 'X vs. Y');
$pl->close;
    
@end example


There is also a Perl PLplot interface on @uref{http://www.cpan.org,CPAN} which is not dependent on PDL.
The Perl module is called @uref{http://search.cpan.org/%7Etjenness/,Graphics::PLplot} and is
appropriate for small data arrays. The API is very similar to the C
API except that if the number of elements in an array is required by
the C function the perl interface calculates it automatically. Also,
return values are returned and not supplied as arguments. Here is the
PDL example above translated to Graphics::PLplot:


@example

use Graphics::PLplot qw/ :all /;

@@x = (0..5);
@@y = map @{$_ * $_@} @@x;

plsdev ("xwin");
plinit ();
plcol0 (1);

plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
plline (\@@x, \@@y);

plend ();
      
@end example

@chapter Using PLplot from Python

NEEDS DOCUMENTATION, but here is the short story. We currently (February,
2001) have
switched to dynamic loading of plplot following the generic method given
in the python documentation. Most (???) of the PLplot common API
has been implemented. (For a complete list see plmodules.c and plmodules2.c).
With this dynamic method all the xw??.py examples
work fine and should be consulted for the best way to use PLplot from python.
You may have to set PYTHONPATH to the path where plmodule.so is located
(or eventually installed). For more information see examples/python/README

pytkdemo and the x??.py examples it loads use the plframe widget. Thus,
this method does not currently work under
dynamic loading. They have only worked in the past using the static method
with much hacking and rebuilding of python itself. We plan to try dynamic
loading of all of PLplot (not just the plmodule.c and plmodule2.c wrappers)
including plframe (or a python-variant of this widget) into python at some
future date to see whether it is possible to get pytkdemo and the
x??.py examples working
under dynamic loading, but only the individual stand-alone xw??.py demos
work at the moment.

@chapter The Common API for PLplot

The purpose of this chapter is to document the API for every PLplot
function that should be available across all PLplot language bindings.
This common API between the various languages constitutes the
most important part of the PLplot API that programmers need to know.
Note that in C, these common API routines have a special 
c_ prefix name assigned to them in 
@file{plplot.h}.

What follows is a list of all common API functions of the current 
CVS HEAD with their arguments except for obsolete/deprecated API 
functions which are listed in @ref{Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot,,Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot}.. The
following information is provided for each function:

@enumerate 

@item
The function name and a brief description.

@item
The function as it would be called from C.

@item
A complete description of the function.

@item
A description of each argument that the function takes.

@item
The redacted argument form of the function, currently used 
by the programming languages Fortran95, Python, Java and 
Perl, as well as any language specific variations that 
might occur on the general calling scheme described in 
the following paragraph.

@item
A list of PLplot examples that demonstrate how to use
the function.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Additional PLplot API specialized for each language binding is 
documented in @ref{The Specialized C API for PLplot,,The Specialized C API for PLplot}. and subsequent chapters.

The general calling scheme for the other languages supported
by PLplot is as follows, using the function 
@code{plline} as an example.

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
C: @code{plline(n,x,y)}

@item
F77: @code{plline(n,x,y)}

@item
F95: @code{plline(x,y)}

@item
C++: @code{pls->line(n,x,y)}

@item
Java: @code{pls.line(x,y)}

@item
Perl/PDL: @code{plline($x,$y)}

@item
Python: @code{plline(x,y)}

@item
Tcl/Tk: @code{$w cmd plline $n x y}
@end itemize

@noindent
Note that in some languages the argument n (which specifies
the length of the arrays x and y) is not necessary, this
is what we refer to above as the redacted argument
form of the function.

Begins a new page. For a file driver, the output file is opened if

(In fact some drivers may only support a single page per file, making

page advance via @code{pladv} (@pxref{pladv; Advance the [sub-]page}), but enable familying (see @code{plsfam} (@pxref{plsfam; Set family file parameters})) with a

@samp{@code{window}} corresponds to
the viewport index (in the order which the viewport/windows

more complicated layouts with potentially overlapping viewports
and possibly more than one window (set of world coordinates) per

and the corresponding output world coordinates
corresponds to the last window created that fulfils the criterion
that the relative device coordinates are inside it. Finally, in

inside any viewport/window, then
@samp{@code{window}} is set to -1.

Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but all PLplot 3D
plots require data placed in a uniform grid. This function takes
irregularly sampled data from three input arrays
@samp{x[npts]}, @samp{y[npts]}, and
@samp{z[npts]}, reads the desired grid location from
input arrays @samp{xg[nptsx]} and
@samp{yg[nptsy]}, and returns the gridded data into
output array @samp{zg[nptsx][nptsy]}. The algorithm used
to grid the data is specified with the argument
@samp{type} which can have one parameter specified in
argument @samp{data}.

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
@samp{GRID_NNIDW}, @samp{data}
specifies the number of neighbors to use, the lower the
value, the noisier (more local) the approximation is.

@item
@samp{GRID_NNLI}, @samp{data}
specifies what a thin triangle is, in the range
[1. .. 2.]. High values enable the usage of very thin
triangles for interpolation, possibly resulting in error in
the approximation.

@samp{@code{data}}. This routine bins
the data into @samp{@code{nbin}} bins
equally spaced between
@samp{@code{datmin}} and
@samp{@code{datmax}}, and calls @code{plbin} (@pxref{plbin; Plot a histogram from binned data})
to draw the resulting histogram. Parameter
@samp{@code{opt}} allows, among
other things, the histogram either to be plotted in an existing window
or causes @code{plhist} (@pxref{plhist; Plot a histogram from unbinned data}) to call @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) with suitable limits before plotting
the histogram.

The existing axes are not rescaled to fit the histogram data,
without this flag, @code{plenv} (@pxref{plenv; Set up standard window and draw box}) is called to set the world coordinates.

@item
@samp{@code{opt}=PL_HIST_IGNORE_OUTLIERS|...}:
Data outside the given extremes are not taken into account.
This option should probably be combined with

Draws a polygon in 3 space defined by @samp{@code{n}}
points in
@samp{@code{x}},
@samp{@code{y}}, and
@samp{@code{z}}.
Setup like @code{plline3} (@pxref{plline3; Draw a line in 3 space}), but differs from that function in that @code{plpoly3} (@pxref{plpoly3; Draw a polygon in 3 space})
attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable depending on the
order of the points within the arrays and the value of
@samp{@code{ifcc}}. If the back of
polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn. If this isn't what
you want, then use @code{plline3} (@pxref{plline3; Draw a line in 3 space}) instead.

The points are assumed to be in a plane, and the directionality of
the plane is determined from the first three points. Additional
points do not @i{have} to lie on the plane defined
by the first three, but if they do not, then the determination of
visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate... So if you're 3 space
polygons are too far from planar, consider breaking them into smaller
polygons. 3 points define a plane :-).

@i{Bugs}: If one of the first two segments is of
zero length, or if they are colinear, the calculation of visibility
has a 50/50 chance of being correct. Avoid such situations :-). See
@file{x18c.c} for an example of this problem.

Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship
between position in the color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or
RGB color space (see @ref{Color Map1,,Color Map1}.). May be called at
any time. 

The idea here is to specify a number of control points that define
the mapping between palette 1 input positions (intensities) and HLS (or RGB). Between
these points, linear interpolation is used which
gives a smooth variation of
color with input position. Any number of control points may be specified,
located at arbitrary positions, although typically 2 - 4
are enough. Another way of stating this is that we are traversing a
given number of lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we move through
color map1 entries. The control points at the minimum and maximum
position (0 and 1) must always be specified. By adding more control
points you can get more variation. One good technique for plotting
functions that vary about some expected average is to use an
additional 2 control points in the center (position ~= 0.5) that are
the same lightness as the background (typically white for paper output,
black for crt), and same hue as the boundary control points. This
allows the highs and lows to be very easily distinguished.

Each control point must specify the position in color map1 as well as
three coordinates in HLS or RGB space. The first point
@i{must} correspond to position = 0, and the last to
position = 1.

The hue is interpolated around the "front" of the color wheel
(red<->green<->blue<->red) unless the "rev" flag is set to true,
in which case interpolation (between the @samp{i} and
@samp{i + 1} control point for @samp{rev[i]})
proceeds around the back (reverse) side. Specifying rev=NULL is
equivalent to setting rev[]= false for every control point.

The purpose of this Chapter is to document the API for each Fortran 95 function
in PLplot that differs substantially (usually in argument lists)
from the common API that has already been
documented in @ref{The Common API for PLplot,,The Common API for PLplot}..

Normally, the common API is wrapped in such a way for Fortran 95 that there is
and one-to-one correspondence between each Fortran 95 and C argument
with the exception of arguments that indicate array sizes
(see @ref{Fortran 95 Language,,Fortran 95 Language}.
for discussion). However, for certain routines documented in this
chapter the Fortran 95 argument lists
necessarily differ substantially from the C versions.

@chapter The Specialized Fortran 77 API for PLplot

The purpose of this Chapter is to document the API for each Fortran 77 function
in PLplot that differs substantially (usually in argument lists)
from the common API that has already been
documented in @ref{The Common API for PLplot,,The Common API for PLplot}..

Normally, the common API is wrapped in such a way for Fortran 77 that there is
and one-to-one correspondence between each Fortran 77 and C argument
(see @ref{Fortran 77 Language,,Fortran 77 Language}.
for discussion). However, for certain routines documented in this
chapter the Fortran 77 argument lists
necessarily differ substantially from the C versions.

This chapter is incomplete and NEEDS DOCUMENTATION of, e.g., the Fortran 77
equivalent of the plshade C routines.

Set the escape character for text strings. From
Fortran 77 it needs to be the decimal ASCII value. Only
selected characters are allowed to prevent the user from shooting
himself in the foot (For example, a \ isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's use
of backslash as a character escape). Here are the allowed escape

@node API compatibility definition, Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot, The Specialized Fortran 77 API for PLplot, Top
@chapter API compatibility definition

This chapter presents the formal definition of what is considered to be
in the PLplot library API. It is assumed that major new releases of
PLplot will have substantial backwards incompatible changes in the API,
but the PLplot developers commit to introducing as few as possible of
such incompatibilities between minor releases such that stability
across those minor releases is practically guaranteed. In all cases
where backwards incompatible changes have been introduced, then the
library soname will be changed (for operating systems such as Linux
that support versioned shared libraries).

The information in this chapter regards version 5.7.4 of
PLplot, released on 2007-08-13.

@section   What is in the API?  

The formal definition of the PLplot C API is everything that is defined
in the include file @file{plplot.h}. This includes all
the function prototypes, the defined structures and the semantics of
the constants. The list of symbols currently exported by the shared
library @file{libplplot.h} that are declared in
@file{plplot.h} is the following:

Another important aspect of compatibility regard the Application
Binary Interface (ABI). Backwards compatibility can be broken by
changes in the C structures made public through
@file{plplot.h}. Currently, they are:

    int  (*handler)	(char *, char *, void *);
    void *client_data;
    void *var;
    long mode;

    int pX, pY;			/* absolute device coordinates of pointer */
    PLFLT dX, dY;		/* relative device coordinates of pointer */

@node Regression test for backwards compatibility, , What is in the API?, API compatibility definition
@section   Regression test for backwards compatibility  

Since PLplot is developed by so many people, the task of checking for
backwards compatiblity of the library is very hard. As for the 5.3.1
release, we do not have any rigorous regression test for check
whether the library is really backwards compatible.

However, here are some rules to be followed by the Release Manager
prior to releasing a new version of PLplot:

@itemize @bullet{}

@item
Check if there are any changes in
@file{plplot.h}. If no prototype is changed,
then the chances are high that no backwards compatibilities
have been introduced. If new functions has been added, then
the library soname will be kept, although the libtool soversion
string in @file{configure.ac} must be changed
from @samp{x:y:z} to
@samp{(x+1):0:(z+1)}. See the
libtool manual for details.

@item
A necessary, but not sufficient test consists of the following:
first, install the previous released version of PLplot in the
system and compile all the examples
@file{examples/c/x??c.}. After that, install the
to-be-released version of PLplot and try to run the previously
compiled examples. If they either link or run incorrectly,
then backwards incompatibilities have been introduced and the
soversion string must be upgraded from @samp{x:y:z}
to @samp{(x+1):0:0}.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimal documentation for
obsolete/deprecated API that appears in our C library to provide backwards
compatibility until our next major release, PLplot-6, where these functions
will disappear. Do not use these functions, and if you already use them
in legacy PLplot applications, replace them by the suggested
equivalents so you won't be caught out by the next major PLplot release.

The configure script looks for default
configuration options first in @file{./cf_plplot.in}.
If that file is not found, the script then looks in
@file{$HOME/config/cf_plplot.in}.
Finally, if neither file is found or if the found file
does not have a particular default option, then the script
uses the above defaults. Here is one example of a default
configuration file. Adapt this for your needs or else use
the command-line parameters for the configuration file.

@example

# --*-sh-*---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PLplot configure script default variables.
#
#
# Note: the internal representation of the --with-<option> and
# --enable-<option> command line switches actually uses an underscore,
# e.g. with_<option> and enable_<option>.  Don't forget!
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Method to turn off Fortran and C++ bindings.
 
enable_cxx="no" 
enable_f77="no" 
  
# Devices are selected by --enable or --disable on the command line, but 
# only shell variables of the form enable_<option> are recognized here. 
   
enable_tek4010="no" 
enable_mskermit="no" 
enable_conex="no" 
enable_vlt="no" 
enable_versaterm="no" 
enable_xfig="no"

@subsection Linux/Unix Building of C Programmes that Use the   Installed PLplot Libraries

This is incomplete. NEEDS DOCUMENTATION. 
@file{$prefix/bin/plplot-config} is a
useful tool for helping with building of C programmes that use 
the PLplot libraries.

@example

./plplot-config --help
Usage: plplot-config [OPTIONS]
Options:
        [--prefix[=DIR]]
	[--version]
	[--libs]
	[--cflags]
	[--with-c++]
	[--help]
@end example

@noindent
For example, the @samp{--cflags} parameter displays the
flags for compiling, and the @samp{--libs} parameter
displays the flags for linking your application. The displayed flags
are exactly consistent with the configuration specified when PLplot
was last built and installed.

@bye
