bit RGB value 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplscol0\fP(\fIicol0\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIg\fP, \fIb\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set a given color by 8-bit RGB value for color map0 (see the PLplot documentation).  Overwrites the previous color value for the given index and, thus, does not result in any additional allocation of space for colors.

\fIr\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of red in the color. 
.TP
